  <abstract>We present an approach for detecting salient
(important) dates in texts in order to auto-
matically build event timelines from a search
query ( e.g. the name of an event or person,
etc.). This work was carried out on a corpus
of newswire texts in English provided by the
Agence France Presse (AFP). In order to ex-
tract salient dates that warrant inclusion in an
event timeline, we ﬁrst recognize and normal-
ize temporal expressions in texts and then use
a machine-learning approach to extract salient
dates that relate to a particular topic. We fo-
cused only on extracting the dates and not the
events to which they are related.</abstract>
  <introduction>
Our aim here was to build thematic timelines for
a general domain topic deﬁned by a user query.
This task, which involves the extraction of important
events, is related to the tasks of Retrospective Event
Detection (Yang et al., 1998), or New Event Detec-
tion, as deﬁned for example in Topic Detection and
Tracking (TDT) campaigns (Allan, 2002).
The majority of systems designed to tackle this
task make use of textual information in a bag-of-
words manner. They use little temporal informa-
tion, generally only using document metadata, such
as the document creation time (DCT). The few sys-
tems that do make use of temporal information (such
as the now discontinued Google timeline), only ex-
tract absolute, full dates (that feature a day, month
and year). In our corpus, described in Section 3.1,
we found that only 7% of extracted temporal expres-
sions are absolute dates.We distinguish our work from that of previous re-
searchers in that we have focused primarily on ex-
tracted temporal information as opposed to other
textual content. We show that using linguistic tem-
poral processing helps extract important events in
texts. Our system extracts a maximum of temporal
information and uses only this information to detect
salient dates for the construction of event timelines.
Other types of content are used for initial thematic
document retrieval. Output is a list of dates, ranked
from most important to least important with respect
to the given topic. Each date is presented with a set
of relevant sentences.
We can see this work as a new, easily evaluable
task of “date extraction”, which is an important com-
ponent of timeline summarization.
In what follows, we ﬁrst review some of the re-
lated work in Section 2. Section 3 presents the re-
sources used and gives an overview of the system.
The system used for temporal analysis is described
in Section 4, and the strategy used for indexing and
ﬁnding salient dates, as well as the results obtained,
are given in Section 51.
</introduction>
  <corps>The ISO-TimeML language (Pustejovsky et al.,
2010) is a speciﬁcation language for manual anno-
tation of temporal information in texts, but, to the
best of our knowledge, it has not yet actually been
used in information retrieval systems. Neverthe-
1This work has been partially funded by French National
Research Agency (ANR) under project Chronolines (ANR-10-
CORD-010). We would like to thank the French News Agency
(AFP) for providing us with the corpus.less, (Alonso et al., 2007; Alonso, 2008; Kanhabua,
2009) and (Mestl et al., 2009), among others, have
highlighted that the analysis of temporal informa-
tion is often an essential component in text under-
standing and is useful in a wide range of informa-
tion retrieval applications. (Harabagiu and Bejan,
2005; Saquete et al., 2009) highlight the importance
of processing temporal expressions in Question An-
swering systems. For example, in the TREC-10 QA
evaluation campaign, more than 10% of questions
required an element of temporal processing in order
to be correctly processed (Li et al., 2005a). In multi-
document summarization, temporal processing en-
ables a system to detect redundant excerpts from
various texts on the same topic and to present re-
sults in a relevant chronological order (Barzilay and
Elhadad, 2002). Temporal processing is also useful
for aiding medical decision-making. (Kim and Choi,
2011) present work on the extraction of temporal in-
formation in clinical narrative texts. Similarly, (Jung
et al., 2011) present an end-to-end system that pro-
cesses clinical records, detects events and constructs
timelines of patients’ medical histories.
The various editions of the TDT task have given
rise to the development of different systems that de-
tect novelty in news streams (Allan, 2002; Kumaran
and Allen, 2004; Fung et al., 2005). Most of these
systems are based on statistical bag-of-words mod-
els that use similarity measures to determine prox-
imity between documents (Li et al., 2005b; Brants
et al., 2003). (Smith, 2002) used spatio-temporal in-
formation from texts to detect events from a digital
library. His method used place/time collocations and
ranked events according to statistical measures.
Some efforts have been made for automatically
building textual and graphical timelines. For ex-
ample, (Allan et al., 2001) present a system that
uses measures of pertinence and novelty to con-
struct timelines that consist of one sentence per date.
(Chieu and Lee, 2004) propose a similar system that
extracts events relevant to a query from a collection
of documents. Important events are those reported
in a large number of news articles and each event is
constructed according to one single query and rep-
resented by a set of sentences. (Swan and Allen,
2000) present an approach to generating graphical
timelines that involves extracting clusters of noun
phrases and named entities. More recently, (Yan etal., 2011b; Yan et al., 2011a) used a summarization-
based approach to automatically generate timelines,
taking into account the evolutionary characteristics
of news.
3 Resources and System Overview
3.1 AFP Corpus
For this work, we used a corpus of newswire texts
provided by the AFP French news agency. The En-
glish AFP corpus is composed of 1.3 million texts
that span the 2004-2011 period (511 documents/day
in average and 426 millions words). Each document
is an XML ﬁle containing a title, a date of creation
(DCT), set of keywords, and textual content split
into paragraphs.
3.2 AFP Chronologies
AFP “chronologies” (textual event timelines) are a
speciﬁc type of articles written by AFP journal-
ists in order to contextualize current events. These
chronologies may concern any topic discussed in the
media, and consist in a list of dates (typically be-
tween 10 and 20) associated with a text describing
the related event(s). Figure 1 shows an example of
such a chronology. Further examples are given in
Figure 2. We selected 91 chronologies satisfying the
following constraints:
All dates in the chronologies are between 2004
and 2011 to be sure that the related events
are described in the corpus. For example,
“Chronology of climax to Vietnam War” was
excluded because its corresponding dates do
not appear in the content of the articles.
All dates in the chronology are anterior to the
chronology’s creation date. For example, the
chronology “Space in 2005: A calendar” , pub-
lished in January 2005 and listing scheduled
events, was not selected (because almost no
rocket launches ﬁnally happened on the ex-
pected day).
The temporal granularity of the chronology is
the day. For example, “A timeline of how the
London transport attacks unfolded” , relating
the events hour by hour, is not in our focus.&lt;NewsML Version="1.2" &gt;
&lt;NewsItem xml:lang="en" &gt;
&lt;HeadLine &gt;Key dates in Thai-
land’s political crisis &lt;/HeadLine &gt;
&lt;DateId &gt;20100513T100519Z &lt;/DateId &gt;
&lt;NameLabel &gt;Thailand-politics &lt;/NameLabel &gt;
&lt;DataContent &gt;
&lt;p&gt;The following is a timeline of events since
the protests began, soon after Thailand’s Supreme
Court conﬁscated 1.4 billion dollars of Thaksin’s
wealth for abuse of power. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;March 14 : Tens of thousands of Red Shirts
demonstrate in the capital calling for Abhisit’s gov-
ernment to step down, [...] &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;March 28 : The government and the Reds en-
ter into talks but hit a stalemate after two days
[...]&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;April 3 : Tens of thousands of protesters move
from Bangkok’s historic district into the city’s com-
mercial heart [...] &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;April 7 : Abhisit declares state of emergency
in capital after Red Shirts storm parliament. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;April 8 : Authorities announce arrest warrants
for protest leaders. &lt;/p&gt;
. . .
&lt;/DataContent &gt;
&lt;/NewsItem &gt;
&lt;/NewsML &gt;
Figure 1: Example of an AFP manual chronology.
For learning and evaluation purposes, all
chronologies were converted to a single XML
format. Each document was manually associated
with a user search query made up of the keywords
required to retrieve the chronology.
3.3 System Overview
Figure 3 shows the general architecture of the sys-
tem. First, pre-processing of the AFP corpus tags
and normalizes temporal expressions in each of the
articles (step ¬in the Figure). Next, the corpus is
indexed by the Lucene search engine2(step­).
Given a query, a number of documents are re-
trieved by Lucene ( ®). These documents can be ﬁl-
tered (¯), and dates are extracted from the remain-
ing documents. These dates are then ranked in order
to show the most important ones to the user ( °), to-

4 Temporal and Linguistic Processing
In this section, we describe the linguistic and tempo-
ral information extracted during the pre-processing
phase and how the extraction is carried out. We
rely on the powerful linguistic analyzer XIP (A ¨ıt-
Mokhtar et al., 2002), that we adapted for our pur-
poses.
4.1 XIP
The linguistic analyzer we use performs a deep syn-
tactic analysis of running text. It takes as input
XML ﬁles and analyzes the textual content enclosed
in the various XML tags in different ways that are
speciﬁed in an XML guide (a ﬁle providing instruc-
tions to the parser, see (Roux, 2004) for details).
XIP performs complete linguistic processing rang-
ing from tokenization to deep grammatical depen-
dency analysis. It also performs named entity recog-nition (NER) of the most usual named entity cat-
egories and recognizes temporal expressions. Lin-
guistic units manipulated by the parser are either
terminal categories or chunks. Each of these units
is associated with an attribute-value matrix that con-
tains the unit’s relevant morphological, syntactic and
semantic information. Linguistic constituents are
linked by oriented and labelled n-ary relations de-
noting syntactic or semantic properties of the input
text. A Java API is provided with the parser so that
all linguistic structures and relations can be easily
manipulated by Java code.
In the following subsections, we give details of
the linguistic information that is used for the detec-
tion of salient dates.
4.2 Named Entity Recognition
Named Entity (NE) Recognition is one of the out-
puts provided by XIP. NEs are represented as unary
relations in the parser output. We used the exist-
ing NE recognition module of the English grammar
which tags the following NE types: location names ,
person names andorganization names . Ambigu-
ous NE types (ambiguity between type location or
organization for country names for instance) are
also considered.
4.3 Temporal Analysis
A previous module for temporal analysis was de-
veloped and integrated into the English grammar
(Hagège and Tannier, 2008), and evaluated during
TempEval campaign (Verhagen et al., 2007). This
module was adapted for tagging salient dates. Our
goal with temporal analysis is to be able to tag and
normalize3a selected subset of temporal expressions
(TEs) which we consider to be relevant for our task.
This subset of expressions is described in the follow-
ing sections.
4.3.1 Absolute Dates
Absolute dates are dates that can be normalized
without external or contextual knowledge. This is
the case, for instance, of “On January 5th 2003” .
In these expressions, all information needed for nor-
malization is contained in the linguistic expression.
3We call normalization the operation of turning a temporal
expression into a formated, fully speciﬁed representation. This
includes ﬁnding the absolute value of relative dates.However, absolute dates are relatively infrequent in
our corpus (7%), so in order to broaden the cover-
age for the detection of salient dates, we decided to
consider relative dates, which are far more frequent.
4.3.2 DCT-relative Dates
DCT-relative temporal expressions are those
which are relative to the creation date of the docu-
ment. This class represents 40% of dates extracted
from the AFP corpus. Unlike the absolute dates, the
linguistic expression does not provide all the infor-
mation needed for normalization. External informa-
tion is required, in particular, the date which corre-
sponds to the moment of utterance. In news articles,
this is the DCT. Two sub-classes of relative TEs can
be distinguished. The ﬁrst sub-class only requires
knowledge of the DCT value to perform the normal-
ization. This is the case of expressions like next Fri-
day, which correspond to the calendar date of the
ﬁrst Friday following the DCT. The second sub-class
requires further contextual knowledge for normal-
ization. For example, on Friday will correspond ei-
ther to last Friday or to next Friday depending on
the context where this expression appears ( e.g. He
is expected to come on Friday corresponds to next
Friday while He arrived on Friday corresponds to
last Friday ). In such cases, the tense of the verb
that governs the TE is essential for normalization.
This information is provided by the linguistic analy-
sis carried out by XIP.
4.3.3 Underspeciﬁed Dates
Considering the kind of corpus we deal with
(news), we decided to consider TEs whose granu-
larity is at least equal to a day. As a result, TEs
were normalized to a numerical YYYYMMDD for-
mat (where YYYY corresponds to the year, MM to
the month and DD to the day). In case of TEs with
a granularity superior to the day or month, DD and
MM ﬁelds remain unspeciﬁed accordingly. How-
ever, these underspeciﬁed dates are not used in our
experiments.
4.4 Modality and Reported Speech
An important issue that can affect the calculation of
salient dates is the modality associated with time-
stamped events in text. For instance, the status of a
salient date candidate in a sentence like “The meet-ing takes place on Friday” has to be distinguished
from the one in “The meeting should take place on
Friday” or“The meeting will take place on Friday,
Mr. Hong said” . The time-stamped event meeting
takes place is factual in the ﬁrst example and can
be taken as granted. In the second and third exam-
ples, however, the event does not necessarily occur.
This is expressed by the modality introduced by the
modal auxiliary should (second example), or by the
use of the future tense or reported speech (third ex-
ample). We annotate TEs with information regard-
ing the factuality of the event they modify. More
speciﬁcally, we consider the following features:
Events that are mentioned in the future: If a
time-stamped event is in the future tense, we add a
speciﬁc attribute MODALITY with value FUTURE to
the corresponding TE annotation.
Events used with a modal verb: If a time-
stamped event is introduced by a modal verb such
asshould orwould , then attribute MODALITY to the
corresponding TE annotation has the value MODAL .
Reported speech verbs: Reported speech verbs
(or verbs of speaking) introduce indirect or reported
speech. We dealt with time-stamped events gov-
erned by a reported speech verb, or otherwise ap-
pearing in reported speech. Once again, XIP’s lin-
guistic analysis provided the necessary information,
including the marking of reported speech verbs and
clause segmentation of complex sentences. If a rel-
evant TE modiﬁes a reported speech verb, the anno-
tation of this TE contains a speciﬁc attribute, DE-
CLARATION =”YES”. If the relevant TE modiﬁes
a verb that appears in a clause introduced by a re-
ported speech verb then the annotation contains the
attribute REPORTED =”YES”.
Note that the different annotations can be com-
bined ( e.g.modality and reported speech can occur
for a same time-stamped event). For example, the
TEFriday in“The meeting should take place on Fri-
day, Mr. Hong said” is annotated with both modality
and reported speech attributes.
4.5 Corpus-dependent Special Cases
While we developed the linguistic and temporal an-
notators, we took into account some speciﬁcities of
our corpus. We decided that the TEs today and&lt;DCTvalue="20050105" /&gt;
&lt;ECTYPE="TIMEX" value="unknown" &gt;The year
2004&lt;/EC&gt;was the deadliest &lt;ECTYPE="TIMEX"
value="unknown" &gt;in a decade &lt;/EC&gt;for journalists
around the world, mainly because of the number of reporters
killed in &lt;ECTYPE="LOCORG" &gt;Iraq&lt;/EC&gt;, the
media rights group &lt;ENTYPE="ORG" &gt;Reporters
Sans Frontieres &lt;/EN&gt; (Reporters Without Bor-
ders) said &lt;ECTYPE="DATE" SUBTYPE="REL"
REF="ST" DECLARATION="YES" value
="20050105" &gt;Wednesday &lt;/EC&gt;.

now were not relevant for the detection of salient
dates. In the AFP news corpus, these expressions
are mostly generic expressions synomymous with
nowadays and do not really time-stamp an event
with respect to the DCT. Another speciﬁcity of the
corpus is the fact that if the DCT corresponds to a
Monday, and if an event in a past tense is described
with the associated TE on Monday orMonday , it
means that this event occurs on the DCT day itself,
and not on the Monday before. We adapted the TE
normalizer to these special cases.
4.6 Implementation and Example
As said previously, a NER module is integrated into
the XIP parser, which we used “as is”. The TE tag-
ger and normalizer was adapted from (Hagège and
Tannier, 2008). We used the Java API provided with
the parser to perform the annotation and normal-
ization of TEs. The output for the linguistic and
temporal annotation consists in XML ﬁles where
only selected information is kept (structural infor-
mation distinguishing headlines from news content,
DCT), and enriched with the linguistic annotations
described before (NEs and TEs with relevant at-
tributes corresponding to the normalization and typ-
ing). Information concerning modality, future tense
and reported speech, appears as attributes on the TE
tag. Figure 4 shows an example of an analyzed ex-
cerpt of a news article.
In this news excerpt, only one TE ( Wednesday ) is
normalized as both The year 2004 andin a decade
are not considered to be relevant. The ﬁrst one being
a generic TE and the second one being of granular-
ity superior to a year. The annotation of the relevant
TE has the attribute indicating that it time-stamps an
event realized by a reported speech verb. The nor-malized value of the TE corresponds to the 5th of
January 2005, which is a Wednesday. NEs are also
annotated.
In the entire AFP corpus, 11.5 millions temporal
expressions were detected, among which 845,000
absolute dates (7%) and 4.6 millions normalized
relative dates (40%). Although we have not yet
evaluated our tagging of relative dates, the system
on which our current date normalization is based
achieved good results in the TempEval (Verhagen et
al., 2007) campaign.
5 Experiments and Results
In Section 5.1, we propose two baseline approaches
in order to give a good idea of the difﬁculty of the
task (Section 5.4 also discusses this point). In Sec-
tion 5.2, we present our experiments using simple
ﬁltering and statistics on dates calculated by Lucene.
Finally, Section 5.3 gives details of our experiments
with a learning approach. In our experiments, we
used three different values to rank dates:
occ(d)is the number of textual units (docu-
ments or sentences) containing the date d.
Lucene provides ranked documents together
with their relevance score. luc(d)is the sum of
Lucene scores for textual units containing the
dated.
An adaptation of classical tf.idf for dates:
tf:id f (d) =f(d):logN
d f(d)
where f(d)is the number of occurrences of
datedin the sentence (generally, f(d) = 1 ),N
is the number of indexed sentences and d f(d)
is the number of sentences containing date d.
In all experiments (including baselines), timelines
have been built by considering only dates between
the ﬁrst and the last dates of the corresponding man-
ual chronology. Processing runs were evaluated on
manually-written chronologies (see Section 3.2) ac-
cording to Mean Average Precision (MAP), which
is a widely accepted metric for ranked lists. MAP
gives a higher weight to higher ranked elements than
lower ranked elements. Signiﬁcance of evaluation
results are indicated by the p-value results of Stu-
dent’s t-test ( t(90) = 1 :9867 ).Baselines “only DCTs”

5.1 Baseline Runs
BLDCT.Indexing and search were done at docu-
ment level (i.e.each AFP article, with its title
and keywords, is a document). Given a query,
the top 10,000 documents were retrieved. In
these runs, only the DCT for each document
was considered. Dates were ranked by one of
the three values described above ( occ,lucor
tf:id f ) leading to runs BLocc
DCT,BLluc
DCT and
BLtfid f
DCT.
BLabs.Indexing and search were done at sentence
level (document title and keywords are added
to sentence text). Given a query, the top 10,000
sentences were retrieved. Only absolute dates
in these sentences were considered. We thus
obtained runs BLocc
abs,BLluc
absandBLtfid f
abs.
Note that in this baseline, as well as in all the
subsequent runs, the information unit was the
sentence because a date was associated to a
small part of the text. The rest of the document
generally contained text that was not related to
the speciﬁc date.
BLmix.Same as BLabs, except that sentences con-
taining no absolute dates were considered and
associated to the DCT.
Table 1 shows results for these baseline runs.
Using only DCTs with Lucene scores or tf.idf(d)
already yielded interesting results, with MAP
around 0.55.

be a sentence containing a normalized date . This
sentence was indexed with the title and keywords of
the AFP article containing it. Given a query, the top
10,000 documents were retrieved. Combinations be-
tween the following ﬁltering operations were pos-
sible, by removing all dates associated with a re-
ported speech verb ( R), a modal verb ( M) and/or
a future verb ( F). All these ﬁltering operations were
intended to remove references to events that were
not certain, thereby minimizing noise in results.
These processing runs are named SDruns, with
indices representing the ﬁltering operations. For ex-
ample, a run obtained by ﬁltering modal and future
verbs is called SDM;F. In all combinations, dates
were ranked by the sum of Lucene scores for these
sentences ( luc) or by tf:id f4.
Table 2 presents the results for this series of exper-
iments. MAP values are much higher than for base-
lines. Using tf:id f (d)is only very slightly better
thanluc. Filtering operations bring some improve-
ment but the beneﬁts of these different techniques
have to be further investigated.
5.3 Machine-Learning Runs
We used our set of manually-written chronologies
as a training corpus to perform machine learning
experiments. We used IcsiBoost5, an implementa-
4We do not present runs where dates are ranked by the num-
ber of times they appear in retrieved sentences ( occ), as we did
for baselines, since results are systematically lower.
5http://code.google.com/p/icsiboost/tion of adaptative boosting (AdaBoost (Freund and
Schapire, 1997)).
In our approach, we consider two classes: salient
dates are dates that have an entry in the manual
chronologies, while non-salient dates are all other
dates. This choice does, however, represent an im-
portant bias. The choices of journalists are indeed
very subjective, and chronologies must not exceed a
certain length, which means that relevant dates can
be thrown away. These issues will be discussed in
Section 5.4.
The classiﬁer instances were not all sentences re-
trieved by the search engine. Using all sentences
would not yield a useful feature set. We rather ag-
gregated all sentences corresponding to the same
date before learning the classiﬁer. Therefore, each
instance corresponded to a single date, and features
were ﬁgures concerning the set of sentences contain-
ing this date.
Features used in this series of runs are as follows:
1. Features representing the fact that the more
a date is mentioned, the more important it is
likely to be: 1) Sum of the Lucene scores for
all sentences containing the date 2) Number of
sentences containing the date 3) Ratio between
the total weights of the date and weights of all
returned dates 4) Ratio between the frequency
of the date and frequency of all returned dates;
2. Features representing the fact that an important
event is still written about, a long time after it
occurs: 1) Distance between the date and the
most recent mention of this date 2) Distance be-
tween the date and the DCT;
3. Other features: 1) Lucene’s best ranking of the
date 2) Number of times where the date is ab-
solute in the text 3) Number of times where
the date is relative (but normalized) in the text
4) Total number of keywords of the query in the

Because the task is very subjective and (above
all) because of the low quantity of learning data, we
prefered not to opt for a “learning to rank” approach.
We evaluated this approach with a classic 4-fold
cross-validation. Our 91 chronologies were ran-
domly divided into 4 sub-samples, each of them be-
ing used once as test data. The ﬁnal scores, pre-
sented in Table 3, are the average of these 4 pro-
cesses. As shown in this table, the learning approach
improves MAP results by about 0.05 point.</corps>
  <conclusion>This article presents a task of “date extraction” and
shows the importance of taking temporal informa-
tion into consideration and how with relatively sim-
ple temporal processing, we were able to indirectly
point to important events using the temporal infor-
mation associated with these events. Of course, as
our ﬁnal goal consists in the detection of important
events, we need to take into account the textual con-
tent. In future work, we envisage providing, together
with the detection of salient dates, a semantic analy-
sis that will help determine the importance of events.
Another interesting direction in which we soon aim
to work is to consider all textual excerpts that are as-
sociated with salient dates, and use clustering tech-
niques to determine if textual excerpts correspond to
the same event or not. Finally, as our news corpus
is available both for English and French (compara-
ble corpus, not necessarily translations), we aim to
investigate cross-lingual extraction of salient dates</conclusion>
  <discussion>Chronologies hand-written by journalists are a very
useful resources for evaluation of our system, as they
are completely dissociated from our research and are
an exact representation of the output we aim to ob-
tain. However, assembling such a chronology is a
very subjective task, and no clear method for evalu-
ation agreement between two journalists seems im-
mediately apparent. Only experts can build such
chronologies, and calculating this agreement would
require at least two experts from each domain, which
are hard to come by. One may then consider our sys-
tem as a useful tool for building a chronology more
objectively.
To illustrate this point, we chose four speciﬁc top-
ics6and showed one of our runs on each topic to an
AFP expert for these subjects. We asked him to as-
sess the ﬁrst 30 dates of these runs.

tan unrest timeline” ,“Lebanon’s new government: a timeline” ,
“Libya timeline” .Topic APC APE

Lebanon 0.4673 0.7652
Table 4: Average precision results for manual evaluation
on 4 topics, against the original chronologies ( APC), and
the expert assessment ( APE).
Table 4 presents results for this evaluation, com-
paring average precision values obtained 1) against
the original, manual chronologies ( APC), and 2)
against the expert assessment ( APE). These values
show that, for 3 runs out of 4, many dates returned
by the system are considered as valid by the expert,
even if not presented in the original chronology.
Even if this experiment is not strong enough to
lead to a formal conclusion ( post-hoc evaluation
with only 4 topics and a single assessor), this tends
to show that our system produces usable outputs and
that our system can be of help to journalists by pro-
viding them with chronologies that are as useful and
objective as possible.</discussion>

  <abstract>We test the Distributional Inclusion Hypothesis, which states that hypernyms tend to occur in
a superset of contexts in which their hyponyms are found. We ﬁnd that this hypothesis only
holds when it is applied to relevant dimensions. We propose a robust supervised approach that
achieves accuracies of .84 and .85 on two existing datasets and that can be interpreted as selecting
the dimensions that are relevant for distributional inclusion.</abstract>
  <introduction>
One of the main criticisms of distributional models has been that they fail to distinguish between semantic
relations: Typical nearest neighbors of dogare words like cat,animal ,puppy ,tail, orowner , all obviously
related to dog, but through very different types of semantic relations. On these grounds, Murphy (2002)
argues that distributional models cannot be a valid model of conceptual representation. Distinguishing
semantic relations are also crucial for drawing inferences from distributional data, as different semantic
relations lead to different inference rules (Lenci, 2008). This is of practical import for tasks such as
Recognizing Textual Entailment or RTE (Geffet and Dagan, 2004).
For these reasons, research has in recent years started to attempt the detection of speciﬁc semantic
relationships, and current results suggest that distributional models can, in fact, distinguish between
semantic relations, given the right similarity measures (Weeds et al., 2004; Kotlerman et al., 2010; Lenci
and Benotto, 2012; Herbelot and Ganesalingam, 2013; Santus, 2013). Because of its relevance for RTE
and other tasks, much of this work has focused on hypernymy. Hypernymy is the semantic relation
between a superordinate term in a taxonomy (e.g. animal ) and a subordinate term (e.g. dog).
Distributional approaches to date for detecting hypernymy, and the related but broader relation of
lexical entailment, have been unsupervised (except for Baroni et al. (2012)) and have mostly been based
on the Distributional Inclusion Hypothesis (Zhitomirsky-Geffet and Dagan, 2005; Zhitomirsky-Geffet
and Dagan, 2009), which states that more speciﬁc terms appear in a subset of the distributional contexts
in which more general terms appear. So, animal can occur in all the contexts in which dogcan occur,
plus some contexts in which dogcannot – for instance, rights can be a typical cooccurrence for animal
(e.g. “animal rights”), but not so much for dog(e.g. #“dog rights”).
This paper takes a closer look at the Distributional Inclusion Hypothesis for hypernymy detection. We
show that the current best unsupervised approach is brittle in that their performance depends on the space
they are applied to. This raises the question of whether the Distributional Inclusion Hypothesis is correct,
and if so, under what circumstances it holds. We use a simple supervised approach to relation detection
that has good performance (accuracy .84 on B LESS , .85 on the lexical entailment dataset of Baroni et
al. (2012)) and works well across different spaces.1Furthermore, we show that it can be interpreted
as selecting dimensions for which the Distributional Inclusion Hypothesis does hold. So, our answer is
to propose the Selective Distributional Inclusion Hypothesis : The Distributional Inclusion Hypothesis
holds, but only for relevant dimensions.

  <corps>Distributional models. Distributional models represent a word through the contexts in which it has
been observed, usually in the form of a vector representation (Turney and Pantel, 2010). A target word
is represented as a vector in a high-dimensional space in which the dimensions are context items (for
example, other words) and the coordinates of the vector indicate the target’s degree of association with
each context item. In this paper, we also use dimensionality reduced spaces in which dimensions do not
stand for individual context items anymore.
Pattern-based approaches to inducing semantic relations. Early work on automatically inducing se-
mantic relations between words, starting with Hearst (1992), uses textual patterns. For example, “[NP 1]
and other [NP 2]” implies that NP 2is a hypernym of NP 1. Pattern-based approaches have been applied
to meronymy (Berland and Charniak, 1999; Girju et al., 2003; Girju et al., 2006), synonymy (Lin et al.,
2003), co-hyponymy (Snow et al., 2005), hypernymy (Cimiano et al., 2005), and several relations be-
tween verbs (Chklovski and Pantel, 2004). Pantel and Pennachiotti (2006) generalize the idea to a wide
variety of relations. Turney (2006) uses vectors of patterns to determine similarity of semantic relations.
A task related to semantic relation induction is the extension of an existing taxonomy (Buitelaar et al.,
2005). Snow et al. (2006) do this by using hypernymy and co-hyponymy detectors.
Lexical entailment, hypernymy, and the Distributional Inclusion Hypothesis. Weeds et al. (2004)
introduce the notion of distributional generality , wherevis distributionally more general than uifu
appears in a subset of the contexts in which vis found, and speculate that hypernyms ( v) should be more
distributionally general than hyponyms ( u). Zhitomirsky-Geffet and Dagan (2005; 2009) introduce the
term Distributional Inclusion Hypothesis for the idea that distributional generality encodes hypernymy
or the more loosely deﬁned relation of lexical entailment .
Weeds and Weir (2003) measure distributional generality using a notion of precision (eq. 1). Here and
in all equations below, uis the narrower term, and vthe more general one. Abusing notation, we write u
for both a word and its associated vector /angbracketleftu1,...,u n/angbracketright. Kotlerman et al. (2010) predict lexical entailment
with the balAPinc measure, a modiﬁcation of the Average Precision (AP) measure (eq. 2). The general
notion is that scores should increase with the number of dimensions of vthatushares, and also give more
weight to the highly ranked dimensions (i.e. largest magnitude) of the narrower term u. This is captured
inAPinc by computing precision P(r)at every rank ramongu’s dimensions – where precision is the
fraction of dimensions shared with v–, and weighting by the rank of the same dimension in the broader
term,rel/prime(v,r,u ). The ﬁnal measure, balAPinc , smooths using the LINsimilarity measure (Lin, 1998).
(We only sketch this measure here due to its complexity; details are given in Kotlerman et al. (2010).)

TheClarkeDE measure (Clarke, 2009) computes degree of entailment as the degree to which the nar-
rower termuhas lower values than vacross all dimensions (eq. 3). Lenci and Benotto (2012) introduce
theinvCL measure, which uses ClarkeDE to measure both distributional inclusion of uinvand distri-
butional non-inclusion ofvinu(eq. 4). While all other measures interpret the Distributional Inclusion
Hypothesis as the degree to which a ⊆relation holds, Lenci and Benotto test the degree to which proper
inclusion /subsetnoteqlholds. They consider not only the degree to which the contexts of the narrower terms are
included in the contexts of the wider term, but also determine the degree to which the wider term has
contexts that the narrower term does not have. CL(u,v) =/summationtextn

Like Lenci and Benotto, we focus on the stricter hypernymy relation, rather than lexical entailment.
We believe that the different relations that make up lexical entailment have different distributional indi-
cations and that, for that reason, it will be easier to detect the relations separately than together.
Baroni et al. (2012) proposes a supervised approach to hypernymy detection that represents two words
as the concatenation of their vectors. They also mention in passing another supervised approach that
represents two words as the component-wise difference of their vectors. These are broadly the two
approaches that we test, though we introduce signiﬁcant modiﬁcations.
3 Data
3.1 Distributional Vector Spaces
We use three standard types of distributional spaces.
U+W2: This space is based on a concatenation of the Gigaword, BNC, English Wackypedia and
ukWaC corpora (Baroni et al., 2009). The corpora are POS-tagged and lemmatized. We keep only
content words (nouns, proper nouns, adjectives and verbs) with a corpus frequency of 500 or larger. The
resulting U+ corpus has roughly 133K word types and 2.8B word tokens. We created a vector space by
counting co-occurrences of these word types within a window of two words on the left and the right,
using the top 20k most frequent content words as dimensions. The space was transformed using Positive
Pointwise Mutual Information (PPMI).
U+Sent: The U+Sent space is constructed the same way as U+W2, but uses full sentence contexts
instead of 2-word windows.
TypeDM: This space is extracted from the TypeDM tensors (Baroni and Lenci, 2011). TypeDM con-
tains a list of weighted tuples, /angbracketleft/angbracketleftw1,l,w 2/angbracketright,σ/angbracketright, wherew1andw2are content words, lis a corpus-derived
syntagmatic relationship between the words, and σis a weight estimating saliency of the relationship. We
construct vectors for every unique w1using the set of/angbracketleftl,w 2/angbracketrightpairs as dimensions and corresponding σ
values as dimension weights. We select TypeDM for its excellent performance in previous comparisons
of distributional hypernymy measures (Lenci and Benotto, 2012).
Reduced Spaces: In some experiments, we use dimensionality reduced spaces. We reduce all three
spaces to 300 dimensions using Singular Value Decomposition. We use a subscript to denote reduced
spaces, e.g. U+W2 300. When necessary, we use the term original dimensions to refer to the vector
dimensions from the original, non-reduced spaces (e.g. U+W2); the term latent dimensions refers to the
dimensions in the reduced spaces (e.g. U+W2 300).
3.2 Evaluation Data Sets
BLESS :The B LESS data set (Baroni and Lenci, 2011) covers 200 concepts , or concrete and unambigu-
ous terms (divided into 17 different general concept classes , including vehicle andground mammal ), and
their relationships to other nouns, called relata . Example concepts include vanandhorse . Each concept
is related to several relata through different semantic relations . Following Lenci and Benotto (2012), we
focus on the four semantic relations where both concepts and relata are nouns, for a total 14K data points:
Hypernymy, denoting a superset relationship (e.g. animal -dog); Co-hyponymy, denoting words that share
a common hypernym (e.g. dog-cat); Meronymy, denoting a part-whole relationship (e.g. tail-dog); and
Random, denoting no relationship between the words (e.g. dog-computer ). ●●●●

ENTAILMENT :(Baroni et al., 2012): The E NTAILMENT data set consists of 2,770 word pairs, bal-
anced between positive ( house -building ) and negative ( leader -rider ) examples of hypernymy, with 1376
unique hyponyms and 1016 unique hypernyms. The positive examples were generated by selecting direct
hypernym relationships from WordNet, the negative examples by randomly permuting the hypernyms of
the positive examples, and then manually checking correctness.
4 Distributional Inclusion across Spaces
We test several unsupervised distributional approaches to hypernymy detection from the literature, fo-
cusing on the underlying vector space representation as the main parameter that we vary. We use the
three spaces described in Section 3. We test four hypernymy detection approaches, all of them similarity
measures based on the Distributional Inclusion Hypothesis: WeedsPrec ,balAPinc ,ClarkeDE , and invCL .
Our baseline is the standard cosine measure. We evaluate on the B LESS dataset.
To evaluate on B LESS , we follow the evaluation scheme laid out in Baroni and Lenci (2011). Given a
space and similarity measure, we compute similarity for each concept and relatum. For each concept, we
select its nearest neighbors (according to the given similarity measure) in each of the four relations (C O-
HYP, HYPER , MERO, RANDOM ), and transform the corresponding four similarities to z-scores. Across
all concepts, this yields four sets of z-normalized similarity scores, one for each relation. These four sets
describe the relative similarity of concepts to their nearest neighbors in different relations. Tukey’s Hon-
estly Signiﬁcant Difference test is used for testing whether scores differ signiﬁcantly between relations
(threshold:p&lt; 0.05).
Figure 1 shows the distributions of z-scores for invCL for the four relations, with one graph for each
of the three spaces we consider. For this illustration, we focus on invCL because it shows the overall best
performance at identifying hypernymy. The rightmost plot in Figure 1 replicates the analysis of Lenci
and Benotto (2012), who used the TypeDM space. It conﬁrms their ﬁnding that invCL gives signiﬁcantly
higher values to hypernyms than co-hyponyms – at least on this space. However, in the U+W2 and
U+Sent spaces (leftmost and middle plot), invCL clearly loses any ability to rank hypernyms the highest;
indeed, in both spaces, co-hyponymy and meronymy both have signiﬁcantly higher z-scores than hyper-
nymy. Concerning the other measures, we found that they patterned with invCL . On TypeDM, ClarkeDE
andWeedsPrec had signiﬁcantly higher nearest-neighbor values for hypernyms than co-hyponyms.2On
U+W2 and U+Sent, all measures ranked co-hyponyms signiﬁcantly higher than hypernyms. With the
baseline measure, cosine , the similarity ratings for the C O-HYP relation are always the highest, no matter
the space, followed by H YPER , MERO, RANDOM in this order.
Following Kotlerman et al. (2010) and Lenci and Benotto (2012), we also report the performance of
the measures using Mean Average Precision (MAP). Average Precision (AP) is a measure often used in
2balAPinc could not be evaluated on TypeDM due to computational issues. Measure CO-HYP HYPER MERO RANDOM

the Information Retrieval community with a maximal AP score of 1 when all relevant documents (relata
with the right relationship, in our case) are ranked at the top. We compute AP on a per-concept basis and
report the mean over all 200 AP values. An advantage of MAP is that, while the B LESS analysis method
focuses on nearest neighbors, MAP evaluates the ranking of all relata. A disadvantage of MAP is that it
does not test the degree to which a similarity measure separates different semantic relations, like Tukey
does, so it may overstate the discriminative power of a particular measure. However, it provides a more
intuitive accuracy-like number compared to the B LESS evaluation.
Table 1 shows the Mean Average Precision values for cosine ,ClarkeDE , and invCL on all three spaces.
We also computed WeedsPrec andbalAPinc results, obtaining the same picture; we focus on ClarkeDE
andinvCL because ClarkeDE is a component of invCL , and invCL is the current best measure. The results
corresponding to Lenci and Benotto’s are shown in the lowest part of Table 1, where we report numbers
for TypeDM. Like Lenci and Benotto, we ﬁnd that unsupervised measures other than invCL rank co-
hyponyms the highest, and obtain relatively low results for hypernyms. For invCL in TypeDM, Lenci
and Benotto obtain 0.38 MAP for co-hyponyms and a slightly higher 0.40 for hypernyms, though they
do not report signiﬁcance testing results. We obtain 0.38 for co-hyponyms and 0.36 for hypernyms, and
the difference is not signiﬁcant.3Even though our results are slightly different from those in Lenci and
Benotto (2012), both our results and theirs point to at most a weak preference of invCL for hypernyms
over co-hyponyms. Moreover, in the U+W2 and U+Sent spaces we see that all three measures are very
poor at identifying hypernyms, and the co-hyponymy relation stubbornly persists as most relevant to all
three measures, by a large margin.
Our results thus constitute a puzzle for the Distributional Inclusion Hypothesis. It seems that there
must be some merit to the hypothesis: On one particular space, namely TypeDM, the nearest neighbors
in the hypernymy relation had higher similarity scores than any other relation by a signiﬁcant margin.
This was true for all the hypernymy detectors we studied. But even on TypeDM, the MAP evaluation
showed at most a weak hypernymy signal, and when spaces other than TypeDM were used, the effect
vanished altogether. So how strong an indication for hypernymy can we expect from distributional
inclusion measures in general? We will return to this question below, where our answer will be: The
Distributional Inclusion Hypothesis seems to hold after all, but it needs to be applied to the right kind of
dimensions – and a supervised approach can help in picking the right dimensions.
As the unsupervised approaches struggle to detect hypernymy and do not seem robust to changes in
standard space parameters, we think it is time to consider supervised approaches. In the next section, we
explore two simple supervised approaches that show good performance and are robust to changes in the
underlying space.
3Wilcoxon signed-rank test. 5 Supervised Hypernymy Detection
We use two simple, supervised models for predicting B LESS and E NTAILMENT relations. The ﬁrst
(Concat) is a model previously proposed by Baroni et al. (2012). The second (Diff) takes up an idea
from a footnote in Baroni et al. (2012), but while that footnote stated that the approach in question did
not work, we ﬁnd that, with a few modiﬁcations, it obtains the best performance – and can be interpreted
as a supervised version of the Distributional Inclusion Hypothesis. Note that while we used unreduced
spaces in the previous section, we now use reduced spaces throughout (these are the spaces with the 300
subscript), in order not to have more features than data points.
5.1 Models, Features, and Method
Concat: We use a standard Support Vector Machine (SVM) classiﬁer with a concatenation of vectors as
input features. SVMs are binary classiﬁers which learn the maximum margin hyperplane separating the
two classes. SVMs employ kernel functions to ﬁnd the hyperplanes in higher dimensional spaces which
are nonlinear in the original space. As feature vectors for the classiﬁer, we follow Baroni et al. (2012)
and use the concatenation of the latent dimension vectors representing words. For the E NTAILMENT
dataset, we use the concatenation of the hyponym latent vector and the hypernym latent vector for each
word pair as training features, and the entails/doesn’t entail annotations as binary targets. For B LESS ,
we use the concatenation of the concept latent vector and the relatum latent vector as training features,
and the four relationship classes as targets. We choose the four-way task rather than a “hypernymy vs.
other” classiﬁcation because B LESS contains many more co-hyponymy and random than hypernymy
pairs, which would give a very high baseline in the two-way task. Additionally, the other relations in
BLESS , in particular meronymy, may be interesting in their own right.
Since SVMs are binary classiﬁers, we use SciKit-Learn’s default setting to train 6 pairwise-relation
one-vs-one classiﬁers which vote on the ﬁnal answer. We use a polynomial kernel with a degree of 3
and a penalty term of C= 1.0, and all other hyperparameters are chosen using the SciKit-Learn default
values (Pedregosa et al., 2011). No hyperparameters are tuned in any experiment.
Diff: Our second classiﬁer is a Logistic Regression (aka MaxEnt) model trained on difference vectors.
Logistic Regression is a statistical model for binary classiﬁcation. It learns a linear hyperplane sepa-
rating the classes and estimates a probability for classes using a logistic function. We selected Logistic
Regression over other possible linear classiﬁers for its natural ability to give likelihood estimates, which
we believe will be useful in future work in an application of hypernymy classiﬁcation to RTE.
As feature vectors, we use a Mikolov-inspired method of representing word pairs as the difference
vectors between the two words.4Baroni et al. (2012) suggested the use of difference vectors as input
to a classiﬁer, but reported them as unsuccessful. We found difference vectors to be excellent features,
with three important modiﬁcations: a linear classiﬁer is better than a nonlinear one; vectors must be
normalized to have a magnitude of 1 before taking the difference; and squared difference vectors must
also be included as features. So, we represent each word pair with latent vectors (u,v)as a two part
vector/angbracketleftf;g/angbracketright, where
fi=ui
/bardblu/bardbl−vi
/bardblv/bardbl,
gi=f2
i.
These differences features5are analogous to a supervised distributional inclusion measure. The dif-
ference between two words on a particular dimension captures the degree of distributional inclusion on
that dimension. The primary distinction between the difference features and the unsupervised measures
is that the supervised classiﬁer learns to weight the importance of different dimensions. The ffeatures
encode directional aspects of distributional inclusion: that the hyponym contexts should be included in
4After recent work using subtraction to represent analogy in certain neural-network spaces (Mikolov et al., 2013).
5We also tried variations, such as not normalizing vectors and removing the difference squared vector, but found this setting
the best. We also tried the Diff features with an SVM and other nonlinear classiﬁers, but they performed worse. Data set BLESS ENTAILMENT

those of the hypernym (the weight learned is positive), and the hypernym contexts should not be in-
cluded in those of the hyponym (the weight learned is negative). So like invCL , this model uses a “proper
subset” interpretation of the Distributional Inclusion Hypothesis, but only considers selected dimensions
(i.e. those that the model assigns nonzero weights).
The difference-squared features ( g), on the other hand, typically identify dimensions that are notin-
dicative of hypernymy, by learning negative weights on them (more about this in Section 6). Thus, rather
than helping identify hypernyms, they help separate random relations from the rest.
We use a L1 regularizer with a strength of C= 1.0. All other hyperparameters are chosen using
the SciKit-Learn defaults. Since Diff is also a binary classiﬁer, we use SciKit-Learn’s default setting of
training 4 one-vs-all classiﬁers for B LESS , with the most conﬁdent classiﬁer choosing the ﬁnal answer.
Method: For evaluation on B LESS , we hold out one concept and train on the remaining 199 concepts.
We also exclude from the training set any pair containing a relatum which appears in the test set. This
way, no word that appears in the test set has been seen in training. We report the average accuracy across
all concepts. We use the most frequent relation type (random) as our baseline. For the E NTAILMENT data
set, we hold out one hyponym and train on all remaining hyponyms. Again, we exclude from training
any pair containing a hypernym which appears in the test set. We report average accuracy across all
hyponyms. The data set is balanced, so the baseline is 0.5.
5.2 Results
Table 2 shows the performance of the two classiﬁers, Concat and Diff, on both the B LESS and E NTAIL -
MENT datasets, using three underlying spaces. We use the reduced versions of the three spaces, indicated
by the subscript 300. Note that the Concat classiﬁer could not converge using features from TypeDM 300,
so we omit the result. With both methods, we obtain a high accuracy on the two datasets, with results
around .8 against baselines around .5. Our best result is .84 on B LESS and .85 on E NTAILMENT . More-
over, both approaches are in general robust to changes in space parameters (with TypeDM/Concat an
outlier). Still, the U+W2 300space seems to be the best for this task: Its scores are signiﬁcantly6higher
than the rest, except for TypeDM on E NTAILMENT , which achieves the same score as U+W2 300. Diff
achieves signiﬁcantly higher results than Concat.
When provided more information, Concat outperforms Diff. For instance, if cross-validation is done
over all pairs in B LESS in the U+W2 300space, Concat achieves .98 accuracy, while Diff obtains .90.
However, in this setting the same words appear in the training and test sets (albeit in different pairs).
We take this to mean that Concat is memorizing, rather than learning the hypernymy relation. This
emphasizes the need for our stricter evaluation that prevents repetition between training and test sets.
Clearly, both classiﬁers do fairly well at predicting hypernymy relations between words, regardless
of space. Naturally, one should ask what are the classiﬁers capturing that the unsupervised measures
are missing? We propose that the supervised classiﬁers perform essentially the same operation as the
unsupervised measures, but are learning to determine the relevance of dimensions. In particular, Diff
is learning weights on vector difference features. This is equivalent to doing selective distributional
inclusion. In the next section, we test this Selective Distributional Inclusion Hypothesis.

6 Selective Distributional Inclusion
In order to test how well our supervised model is capturing the notion of selective distributional inclusion,
we test each of the unsupervised measures on a smaller space, limited only to the dimensions preferred
by the classiﬁer. We emphasize that we do notaim to show that our supervised method outperforms
unsupervised methods, but rather that the unsupervised methods beneﬁt greatly from feature selection.
Additionally, we analyze which dimensions are selected by the classiﬁer to facilitate understanding of
why these dimensions are important.
6.1 Experiment
We train the Diff classiﬁer using the dimensionality-reduced U+W2 300space with the same method we
use in Section 5. We take the classiﬁer’s learned hyperplane separating hypernyms from other relations,
and project the hyperplane back into the original U+W2 space.7We select the 500 dimensions in the orig-
inal space that are most relevant according to the classiﬁer weights, and test the unsupervised measures
on this new space, which we denote as U+W2 proj.8
The 500 most relevant dimensions are selected as follows: We select the 250 most negatively weighted
original dimensions using the difference features f. These are the features that have smaller values for
hyponyms (e.g. dog) than for hypernyms (e.g. animal ), so they characterize hypernymy. We further select
the 250 most positively weighted original dimensions using the squared-differences features g. These
are the ones where a large difference does not indicate hypernymy.
Figure 2 shows the boxplots for the B LESS analysis: the distributions of nearest-neighbor similarity
scores for the four different semantic relations, for the measures cosine ,ClarkeDE , and invCL . We see
thatinvCL now easily discriminates hypernymy from the other relations in the backprojected space. (The
difference of H YPER and C O-HYP is signiﬁcant.) This is even though the space is based on U+W2, where
invCL failed to rate hypernyms higher than co-hypernyms in Section 4. Unsurprisingly, cosine , which
does not measure distributional inclusion, still prefers C O-HYP.
Table 3 shows the MAP scores for three of the measures in the new U+W2 projspace. (The results
forbalAPinc andWeedsPrec are slightly worse than ClarkeDE .) All measures except for cosine assign
higher scores to hypernyms than they did in the original space (compare to U+W2 part of Table 1). But
it is only invCL that ranks hypernyms signiﬁcantly higher than co-hyponyms.9
7Ideally we would train on the original space to inspect the relevant dimensions. However, there are more dimensions than
examples, so we train on the SVD space and backproject.
8Note that U+W2 proj varies slightly from concept to concept, since the hyperplane is learned on a per-concept basis. It is
important that we use the linear Diff classiﬁer for this reverse-projection procedure, as the separating hyperplane must be linear
in order to complete the projection. In particular, the hyperplane in the Concat classiﬁer cannot be easily backprojected, since
it exists in a higher dimensional space than the projection matrix. Furthermore, it is important that we use a classiﬁer trained
using the difference features because of its analogy to the Distributional Inclusion Hypothesis.

Table 3: Mean Average Precision for the unsupervised measures after selecting the top dimensions from
a supervised model.
For this experiment, we train on all of B LESS except for one concept and then evaluate the unsuper-
vised models on the held-out concept – that is a setting that could, in principle, be used as a hypernymy
detector. If we instead train the supervised model on all of B LESS to determine an upper bound of how
well dimension selection can do on this dataset, MAP for invCL rises to .67.
Overall, these experiments provide strong evidence for the Selective Distributional Inclusion Hypoth-
esis: The Distributional Inclusion Hypothesis holds, but only for relevant dimensions. In addition, hy-
pernymy detectors need to test for “proper inclusion” of distributional contexts in order to really ﬁnd
hypernyms.
Analysis of Selected Dimensions. We examine the 500 dimensions selected by the above procedure,
in order to see what the classiﬁer is learning. As this is for analysis only, the dimensions were selected
by training on all data.
Recall that the difference-squared gfeatures can be interpreted as dimensions that the classiﬁer deems
not indicative of hypernymy. 200 out of the 250 most relevant dimensions by gare Computer Science
related terms like software ,conﬁgure , orLinux . Since ukWaC, the largest corpus we use, is web-based,
it makes sense that it has many CS-related terms, which are noise when it comes to hypernymy detection
for B LESS concepts. Also, we ﬁnd that while the supervised approach needs the negative information
from thegfeatures (for Diff in the U+W2 300space, omitting gfeatures yields a drop from .84 to .8),
the unsupervised measures cannot use it. Dropping gfeatures improves invCL results from .58 to .61.
Theg-based dimensions are explicitly those for which distributional inclusion should nothold, so they
constitute noise to the unsupervised approaches.
Theffeatures can be interpreted as dimensions that characterize hypernyms. An inspection reveals
two clear patterns. First, the features are topically relevant for the B LESS dataset. The 17 concept classes
in the dataset belong to three broader groups: animals, plants, and artifacts. An annotation of the 250
dimensions by one of the authors showed that 58 dimensions are typical of animals ( parasite ,extinct ), 14
typical of vegetables ( ﬂora,nutrient ), 80 typical of artifacts ( repair ,mechanical ), 49 are general terms
(ﬁnd,worthy ), and 49 have no clear interpretation ( thee,enigmatic ). Second, the features are general
terms. For instance, for animals we ﬁnd terms like animal ,insect ,creature ,fauna ,species ,evolutionary ,
pathogen ,nature ,ecology . We also ﬁnd many hypernyms, including many concept class names.
Clearly, the selected features are domain dependent; most are directly related to the concepts and
concept classes of B LESS . We expect that our method should work well for other data sets, given its high
accuracy and the strict training procedure. However, these features are unlikely to be global indicators of
hypernymy. This emphasizes the need, in future work, to ﬁnd a way to automatically determine relevance
on a per-word basis.</corps>
  <conclusion>In this paper, we have tested the Distributional Inclusion Hypothesis, the basis for distributional ap-
proaches to hypernymy. We have found that the hypothesis only works if inclusion is selectively applied
to a set of relevant dimensions.
just by restricting to a smaller space, we evaluated the similarity measures on a variation of the U+W2 space which uses 500
randomly selected dimensions from the original space. The results are approximately unchanged from those on the original
U+W2 space. We have tested two simple supervised approaches to distributional hypernymy detection and have
found that they show good performance, and are robust to changes in the underlying space. Our best
classiﬁer achieves .84 accuracy on B LESS and .85 on the E NTAILMENT dataset of Baroni et al. (2012). It
uses features that encode dimension-wise difference between vectors. This classiﬁer can be interpreted
as selecting the dimensions necessary for the Distributional Inclusion Hypothesis to work, thus as an
effective way to implement selective distributional inclusion.
The next natural step is to use the supervised features to guide development of an unsupervised mea-
sure for hypernymy detection: Now that we have examples, we hope to propose a method which selects
relevant features automatically. We also would like to explore detection of other relationships, such
as meronymy. Finally, we would like to perform an extrinsic evaluation of our hypernymy detection
approach in an actual RTE system.</conclusion>

  <abstract>We introduce BLESS, a data set speciﬁcally
designed for the evaluation of distributional
semantic models. BLESS contains a set of tu-
ples instantiating different, explicitly typed se-
mantic relations, plus a number of controlled
random tuples. It is thus possible to assess the
ability of a model to detect truly related word
pairs, as well as to perform in-depth analy-
ses of the types of semantic relations that a
model favors. We discuss the motivations for
BLESS, describe its construction and struc-
ture, and present examples of its usage in the
evaluation of distributional semantic models.</abstract>
  <introduction>
In NLP, it is customary to distinguish between in-
trinsic evaluations , testing a system in itself, and
extrinsic evaluations , measuring its performance in
some task or application (Sparck Jones and Galliers,
1996). For instance, the intrinsic evaluation of a de-
pendency parser will measure its accuracy in identi-
fying speciﬁc syntactic relations, while its extrinsic
evaluation will focus on the impact of the parser on
tasks such as question answering or machine trans-
lation. Current approaches to the evaluation of Dis-
tributional Semantic Models (DSMs, also known
as semantic spaces, vector-space models, etc.; see
Turney and Pantel (2010) for a survey) are task-
oriented. Model performance is evaluated in “se-
mantic tasks”, such as detecting synonyms, recog-
nizing analogies, modeling verb selectional prefer-
ences, ranking paraphrases, etc. Measuring the per-
formance of DSMs on such tasks represents an in-direct test of their ability to capture lexical mean-
ing. The task-oriented benchmarks adopted in dis-
tributional semantics have not speciﬁcally been de-
signed to evaluate DSMs. For instance, the widely
used TOEFL synonym detection task was designed
to test the learners’ proﬁciency in English as a sec-
ond language, and not to investigate the structure of
their semantic representations (cf. Section 2).
To gain a real insight into the abilities of DSMs to
address lexical semantics, existing benchmarks must
be complemented with a more intrinsically oriented
approach, to perform direct tests on the speciﬁc as-
pects of lexical knowledge captured by the models.
In order to achieve this goal, three conditions must
be met: (i) to single out the particular aspects of
meaning that we want to focus on in the evaluation
of DSMs; (ii) to design a data set that is able to ex-
plicitly and reliably encode the target semantic infor-
mation; (iii) to specify the evaluation criteria of the
system performance on the data set, in order to get
an estimate of the intrinsic ability of DSMs to cope
with the selected semantic aspects. In this paper, we
address these three conditions by presenting BLESS
(Baroni and Lenci Evaluation of Semantic Spaces),
a new data set speciﬁcally geared towards the in-
trinsic evaluation of DSMs, downloadable from:
http://clic.cimec.unitn.it/distsem .
</introduction>
  <corps>There are several benchmarks that have been widely
adopted for the evaluation of DSMs, all of them cap-
turing interesting challenges a DSM should meet.
We brieﬂy review here some commonly used and
representative benchmarks, and discuss why we felt the need to add BLESS to the set. We notice at the
outset of this discussion that we want to carve out a
space for BLESS, and not to detract from the impor-
tance and usefulness of other data sets. We further
remark that we focus on data sets that, like BLESS,
are monolingual English and, while task-oriented,
not aimed at a speciﬁc application setting (such as
machine translation or ontology population).
Probably the most commonly used benchmark in
distributional semantics is the TOEFL synonym de-
tection task introduced to computational linguis-
tics by Landauer and Dumais (1997). It consists of
80 multiple-choice questions, each made of a target
word (a noun, verb, adjective or adverb) and 4 re-
sponse words, 1 of them a synonym of the target.
For example, given the target levied , the matched
words are imposed ,believed ,requested ,correlated ,
the ﬁrst one being the correct choice. The task for
a system is then to pick the true synonym among
the responses. The TOEFL task focuses on a single
semantic relation, namely synonymy. Synonymy is
actually not a common semantic relation and one of
the hardest to deﬁne, to the point that many lexi-
cal semanticists have concluded that true synonymy
does not exist (Cruse, 1986). Just looking at a few
examples of synonym pairs from the TOEFL set will
illustrate the problem: discrepancy /difference ,pro-
liﬁc/productive ,percentage /proportion ,to market /to
sell,color /hue. Moreover, the criteria adopted to
choose the distractors (probably motivated by the
language proﬁciency testing purposes of TOEFL)
are not known. By looking at the set, it is hard
to discern a coherent pattern. In certain cases, the
distractors are semantically close to the target word
(volume ,sample andproﬁt forpercentage ), whereas
in other cases they are not ( home ,trail, and song for
annals ). It it thus not clear whether we are asking the
models to distinguish a semantically related word
(the synonym) from random elements, or a more
tightly related word (the synonym, again) from other
related words. The TOEFL task, ﬁnally, is based on
a discrete choice (either you get the right word, or
you don’t), with the result that evaluation is “quan-
tized”, leading to large accuracy gains for small ac-
tual differences (one model that guesses one more
synonym right than another gets 1.25% more points
in percentage accuracy).
The WordSim 353 data set (Finkelstein et al.,2002) is a widely used example of semantic simi-
larity rating set (see also Rubenstein and Goode-
nough (1965) and Miller and Charles (1991)). Sub-
jects were asked to rate a set of 353 word pairs on a
“similarity” scale and average ratings for each pair
were computed. Models are then evaluated in terms
of correlation of their similarity scores with aver-
age ratings across pairs. From the point of view
of assessing the performance of a DSM, the Word-
Sim (and related) similarity ratings are a mixed bag,
in two senses. First, the data set contains a vari-
ety of different semantic relations. In a recent se-
mantic annotation of the WordSim performed by
Agirre et al. (2009) we ﬁnd that, among the 174
pairs with above-median score (and thus presum-
ably related), there is 1 identical pair, 17 synonym
pairs, 28 hyper-/hyponym pairs, 30 coordinate pairs,
6 holo-/meronym pairs and 92 (more than half) pairs
that are “topically related, but none of the above”.
Second, the scores are a mixture of intuitions about
which of these relations are more semantically tight
and intuitions about more or less connected pairs
within each of the relations. For example, among
the top-rated scores we ﬁnd synonyms such as jour-
ney/voyage and coordinate concepts ( king/queen ).
If we look at the relations characterizing pairs
around the median rating, we ﬁnd both less “per-
fect” synonyms ( monk/brother , that are synonymous
only under an unusual sense of brother ) and less
close coordinates ( skin/eye ), as well as pairs in-
stantiating other, less taxonomically tight relations,
such as many syntagmatically connected items ( fam-
ily/planning ,disaster/area ,bread/butter ). Appar-
ently, a single scale is merging intuitions about se-
mantic similarity of speciﬁc pairs and semantic sim-
ilarity of different relations.
A perhaps more principled way to evaluate DSMs
that has recently gained some popularity is the con-
cept categorization task , where a DSM has to clus-
ter a set of nouns expressing basic-level concepts
into gold standard categories. A particularly care-
fully constructed example is the Almuhareb-Poesio
(AP) set of 402 concepts introduced in Almuhareb
(2006). Concept categorization sets also include the
Battig (Baroni et al., 2010) and ESSLLI 2008 (Ba-
roni et al., 2008) lists. The AP concepts must be
clustered into 21 classes, each represented by be-
tween 13 and 21 nouns. Examples include the ve- hicle class ( helicopter ,motorcycle . . . ), the motiva-
tion class ( ethics ,incitement , . . . ), and the social
unitclass ( platoon ,branch ). The concepts are bal-
anced in terms of frequency and ambiguity, so that,
e.g., the treeclass contains a common concept such
aspine but also the casuarina tree, as well as the
samba tree, that is not only an ambiguous term, but
one where the non-arboreal sense dominates.
Concept categorization data sets, while interest-
ing to simulate one of the basic aspects of human
cognition, are limited to one kind of semantic re-
lation (discovering coordinates). More importantly,
the quality of the results will depend not only on the
underlying DSMs, but also on the clustering algo-
rithm being used (and on how this interacts with the
overall structure of the DSM), thus making it hard
to interpret the performance of DSMs. The forced
“hard” category choice is also problematic, and ex-
aggerates performance differences between models
especially in the presence of ambiguous terms (a
model that puts samba in the occasion class with
dance andball might be penalized as much as a
model that puts it in the monetary currency class).
A more general issue with all benchmarks is that
tasks are based on comparing a single quality score
for each considered model (accuracy for TOEFL,
correlation for WordSim, a clustering quality mea-
sure for AP, etc.). This gives little insight into how
andwhy the models differ. Moreover, there is no
well-established statistical procedure to assess sig-
niﬁcance of differences for most commonly used
measures. Finally, either because the data sets were
not originally intended as standard benchmarks, or
even on purpose, they all are likely to cause coverage
problems even for DSMs trained on very large cor-
pora. Think of the presence of extremely rare nouns
likecasuarina in AP, of proper nouns in WordSim (it
is not clear to us that DSMs are adequate semantic
models for referring expressions – at the very least
they should not be mixed up lightly with common
nouns), or multi-word expressions in other data sets.
3 How we intend to BLESS distributional
semantic evaluation
DSMs measure the distributional similarity between
words, under the assumption that proximity in distri-
butional space models semantic relatedness, includ-ing, as a special case, semantic similarity (Budanit-
sky and Hirst, 2006). However, semantically related
words in turn differ for the type of relation hold-
ing between them: e.g., dogis strongly related to
both animal andtail, but with different types of re-
lations. Therefore, evaluating the intrinsic ability of
DSMs to represent the semantic space of a word en-
tails both (i) determining to what extent words close
in semantic space are actually semantically related,
and (ii) analyzing, among related words, which type
of semantic relation they tend to instantiate. Two
models can be equally very good in identifying se-
mantically related words, while greatly differing for
the type of related pairs they favor.
The BLESS data set complies with both these
constraints. The set is populated with tuples ex-
pressing a relation between a target concept (hence-
forth referred to as concept ) and a relatum concept
(henceforth referred to as relatum ). For instance, in
the BLESS tuple coyote-hyper-animal , the concept
coyote is linked to the relatum animal via the hy-
pernymy relation (the relatum is a hypernym of the
concept). BLESS focuses on a coherent set of basic-
level nominal concrete concepts and a small but ex-
plicit set of semantic relations, each instantiated by
multiple relata. Depending on the type of relation,
relata can be nouns, verbs or adjectives. Moreover,
BLESS also contains, for each concept, a number of
random “relatum” words that are not semantically
related to the concept. Thus, it also allows to evalu-
ate a model in terms of its ability to harvest related
words given a concept (by comparing true and ran-
dom relata), and to identify speciﬁc types of relata,
both in terms of semantic relation and part of speech.
A data set intending to represent a gold standard
for evaluation should include tests items that are as
little controversial as possible. The choice of re-
stricting BLESS to concrete concepts is motivated
by the fact that they are by far the most studied ones,
and there is better agreement about the relations that
characterize them (Murphy, 2002; Rogers and Mc-
Clelland, 2004).
As for the types of relation to include, we are
faced with a dilemma. On the one hand, there is
wide evidence that taxonomic relations, the best un-
derstood type, only represent a tiny portion of the
rich spectrum covered by semantic relatedness. On
the other hand, most of these wider semantic rela- tions are also highly controversial, and may easily
lead to questionable classiﬁcations. For instance,
concepts are related to events, but often it is not clear
how to distinguish the events expressing a typical
function of nominal concepts (e.g., carandtrans-
port), from those events that are also strongly re-
lated to them but without representing their typical
function sensu stricto (e.g., carandﬁx). As will be
shown in Section 4, the BLESS data set tries to over-
come this dilemma by attempting a difﬁcult com-
promise: Semantic relations are not limited to tax-
onomic types and also include attributes and events
strongly related to a concept, but in these cases we
have resorted to underspeciﬁcation, rather than com-
mitting ourselves to questionable granular relations.
BLESS strives to capture those differences and
similarities among DSMs that do not depend on
coverage, processing choices or lexical preferences.
BLESS has been constructed using a publicly avail-
able collection of corpora for reference (see Section
4.4 below), which means that anybody can train a
DSM on the same data and be sure to have perfect
coverage (but this is not strictly necessary). For each
concept and relation, we pick a variety of relata (see
next section) in order to abstract away from inciden-
tal gaps of models or different lexical/topical prefer-
ences. For example, the concept robin has 7 hyper-
nyms including the very general and non-technical
animal andbird and the more speciﬁc and techni-
calpasserine . A model more geared toward techni-
cal terminology might assign a high similarity score
to the latter, whereas a commonsense-knowledge-
oriented DSM might pick bird. Both models have
captured similarity with a hypernym, and we have
no reason, in general semantic terms, to penalize one
or the other. To maximize coverage, we also make
sure that, for each concept and relation, a reason-
able number of relata are frequently attested in our
reference corpora (see statistics below), we only in-
clude single-word relata and, where appropriate, we
include multiple forms for the same relatum (both
sock andsocks as coordinates of scarf – as discussed
in Section 4.1, we avoided similar ambiguous items
as target concepts).
Currently, distributional models for attributional
similarity and relational similarity (Turney, 2006)
are tested on different data sets, e.g., TOEFL and
SAT respectively (brieﬂy, attributional similaritypertains to similarity between a pair of concepts in
terms of shared properties, whereas relational sim-
ilarity measures the similarity of the relations in-
stantiated by couples of concept pairs ). Conversely,
BLESS is not biased towards any particular type of
semantic similarity and thus allows both families of
models to be evaluated on the same data set. Given
a concept, we can analyze the types of relata that are
selected by a model as more attributionally similar
to the target. Alternatively, given a concept-relatum
pair instantiating a speciﬁc semantic relation (e.g.,
hypernymy) we can evaluate a model ability to iden-
tify analogically similar pairs, i.e., others concept-
relatum pairs instantiating the same relation (we do
not illustrate this possibility here).
Finally, by collecting distributions of 200 similar-
ity values for each relation, BLESS allows reliable
statistical testing of the signiﬁcance of differences
in similarity within a DSM (for example, using the
procedure we present in Section 5 below), as well
as across DSMs (for example, via a linear/ANOV A
model with relations and DSMs as factors – not il-
lustrated here).
4 Construction
4.1 Concepts
BLESS includes 200 distinct English concrete
nouns as target concepts, equally divided be-
tween living and non-living entities. Concepts
have been grouped into 17 broader classes: AM-
PHIBIAN REPTILE (including amphibians and rep-
tiles: alligator ),APPLIANCE (toaster ),BIRD
(crow ),BUILDING (cottage ),CLOTHING (sweater ),
CONTAINER (bottle ),FRUIT (banana ),FURNI -
TURE (chair ),GROUND MAMMAL (beaver ),IN-
SECT (cockroach ),MUSICAL INSTRUMENT (vio-
lin),TOOL (i.e., manipulable tools or devices: ham-
mer),TREE (birch ),VEGETABLE (cabbage ),VEHI -
CLE(bus),WATER ANIMAL (including ﬁsh and sea
mammals: herring ),WEAPON (dagger ).
All 200 BLESS concepts are single-word nouns
in the singular form (we avoided concepts such as
socks whose surface form might change depending
on lemmatization choices). The major source we
used to select the concepts were the McRae Norms
(McRae et al., 2005), a collection of living and non-
living basic-level concepts described by 725 sub- jects with semantic features, each tagged with its
property type. As further constraints guiding our
selection, we wanted concepts with a reasonably
high frequency (cf. Section 4.4), we avoided am-
biguous or highly polysemous concepts and we bal-
anced inter- and intra-class composition. Classes in-
clude both prototypical and atypical instances (e.g.,
robin andpenguin forBIRD ), and have a wide spec-
trum of internal variation (e.g., the class VEHICLE
contains wheeled, air and sea vehicles). 175 BLESS
concepts are attested in the McRae Norms, while the
remnants were selected by the authors according to
the above constraints. The average number of con-
cepts per class is 11.76 (median 11; min. 5 AMPHIB -
IAN REPTILE ; max. 21 GROUND MAMMAL ).
4.2 Relations
For each concept noun, BLESS includes several
relatum words, linked to the concept by one of
the following 5 relations. COORD : the relatum
is a noun that is a co-hyponym (coordinate) of
the concept, i.e., they belong to the same (nar-
rowly or broadly deﬁned) semantic class: alligator-
coord-lizard ;HYPER : the relatum is a noun that
is a hypernym of the concept: alligator-hyper-
animal ;MERO : the relatum is a noun referring
to a part/component/organ/member of the concept,
or something that the concept contains or is made
of:alligator-mero-mouth ;ATTRI : the relatum is
an adjective expressing an attribute of the concept:
alligator-attri-aquatic ;EVENT : the relatum is a
verb referring to an action/activity/happening/event
the concept is involved in or is performed by/with
the concept: alligator-event-swim . BLESS also
includes the relations RAN.N,RAN.Jand RAN.V,
which relate the target concepts to control tuples
with random noun, adjective and verb relata, respec-
tively.
The BLESS relations cover a wide spectrum of
information useful to describe a target concept and
to qualify the notion of semantic relatedness: taxo-
nomically related entities ( hyper andcoord ), typical
attributes ( attri), components ( mero ), and associated
events ( event ). However, except for hyper andco-
ord(corresponding to the standard relations of class
inclusion and co-hyponymy respectively), the other
BLESS relations are highly underspeciﬁed. For in-
stance, mero corresponds to a very broad notion ofmeronymy, including not only parts ( dog-tail ), but
also the material ( table-wood ) as well as the mem-
bers ( hospital-patient ) of the entity the target con-
cept refers to (Winston et al., 1987); event is used to
represent the behaviors of animals ( dog-bark ), typi-
cal functions of instruments ( violin-play ), and events
that are simply associated with the target concept
(car-park );attri captures a large range of attributes,
from physical ( elephant-big ) to evaluative ones ( car-
expensive ). As we said in section 3, we did not at-
tempt to further specify these relations to avoid any
commitment to controversial ontologies of property
types. Note that we exclude synonymy both because
of the inherent problems in this very notion (Cruse,
1986), and because it is impossible to ﬁnd convinc-
ing synonyms for 200 concrete concepts.
In BLESS, we have adopted the simplifying as-
sumption that each relation type has relata belonging
to the same part of speech: nouns for hyper ,coord
andmero , verbs for event , and adjectives for attri.
Therefore, we abstract away from the fact that the
same semantic relation can be realized with different
parts of speech, e.g., a related event can be expressed
by a verb ( transport ) or by a noun ( transportation ).
4.3 Relata
The relata of the non-random relations are English
nouns, verbs and adjectives selected and validated
by both authors using two types of sources: se-
mantic sources (the McRae Norms (McRae et al.,
2005), WordNet (Fellbaum, 1998) and ConceptNet
(Liu and Singh, 2004)) and text sources (Wikipedia
and the Web-derived ukWaC corpus, see Section 4.4
below). These resources greatly differ in dimension,
origin and content and therefore provide comple-
mentary views on relata. Their relative contribution
to BLESS also depends on the type of relation and
the target concept. For instance, the rich taxonomic
structure of WordNet has been the main source of in-
formation for many technical hypernyms (e.g. gym-
nosperm ,oscine ), which instead are missing from
more commonsense-oriented resources such as the
McRae Norms and ConceptNet. Meronyms are
rarer in WordNet, and were collected mainly from
the latter two resources, with many technical terms
(e.g., parts of ships, weapons) harvested from the
Wikipedia entries for the target concepts.
Attributes and events were collected from McRae Norms, ConceptNet and ukWaC. In the McRae
Norms, the number of features per concept is fairly
limited, but they correspond to highly distinctive,
prototypical and cognitively salient properties. Con-
ceptNet instead provides a much wider array of as-
sociated events and attributes that are part of our
commonsense knowledge about the target concepts
(e.g., the events park,steal andbreak , etc. for car).
ConceptNet relations such as Created by,Used for,
Capable ofetc. have been analyzed to identify po-
tential event relata, while the Has property relation
has been inspected to look for attributes. The most
salient adjectival and verbal collocates of the tar-
get nouns in the ukWaC corpus were also used to
identify associated attributes and events. For in-
stance, the target concept elephant is not attested in
the McRae Norms and has few properties in Con-
ceptNet. Thus, many of its related events have been
harvested from ukWaC. They include verbs such as
hunt,kill, etc. which are quite salient and frequent
with respect to elephants, although they can hardly
be deﬁned as prototypical properties of this animal.
As a result of the combined use of such different
types of sources, the BLESS relata are representative
of a wide spectrum of semantic information about
the target concepts: they include domain-speciﬁc
terms side by side to commonsense ones, very dis-
tinctive features of a concept (e.g., hoot forowl)
together with attributes and events that are instead
shared by a whole class of concepts (e.g., all animals
have relata such as eat,feed, and live), prototypical
features as well as events and attributes that are sta-
tistically salient for the target, etc.
In many cases, the concept properties contained
in semantic sources are expressed with phrases, e.g.,
lay eggs ,eat grass ,live in Africa , etc. We decided,
however, to keep only single-word relata in BLESS,
because DSMs are typically populated with single
words, and, when they are not, they differ in the
kinds of multi-word elements they store. There-
fore, phrasal relata have always been reduced to
their head: a verb for properties expressed by a verb
phrase, and a noun for properties expressed by a
noun phrase. For instance, from the property lay
eggs, we derived the event relatum lay.
To extract the random relata, we adopted the fol-
lowing procedure. For each relatum that instantiates
a true relation with the concept, we also randomlypicked from our combined corpus (cf. Section 4.4)
another lemma with the same part of speech, and
frequency within 1 absolute logarithmic unit from
the frequency of the corresponding true relatum.
Since picking a random term does not guarantee
that it will not be related to the concept, we ﬁltered
the extracted list by crowdsourcing, using the Ama-
zon Mechanical Turk via the CrowdFlower interface
(CF).1We presented CF workers with the list of
about 15K concept+random-term pairs selected with
the procedure we just described, plus a manually
checked validation set (a “gold set” in CF terminol-
ogy) comprised of 500 concept+true-relatum pairs
and 500 concept+random-term pairs (these elements
are used by CF to determine the reliability of work-
ers, and discard the ratings of unreliable ones), plus a
further set of 1.5K manually checked concept+true-
relatum pairs to make the random-true distribution
less skewed. The workers’ task was, for each pair,
to check a YES radio button if they thought there is
a relation between the words, NO otherwise. The
words were annotated with their part of speech, and
workers were instructed to pay attention to this in-
formation when making their choices. Extensive
commented examples of both related pairs and un-
related ones were also provided in the instruction
page. A minimum of 2 CF workers rated each pair,
and, conservatively, we preserved only those items
(about 12K) that were unanimously rated as unre-
lated to their concept by the judges. See Table 1 for
summary statistics about the preserved random sets
(nouns: RAND .N, adjectives: RAN.J, verbs: RAN.V).
4.4 BLESS statistics
For frequency information, we rely on the combi-
nation of the freely available ukWaC and Wackype-
dia corpora (size: 1.915B and 820M tokens, respec-
tively).2The data set contains 200 concepts that
have a mean corpus frequency of 53K occurrences
(min. 1416 chisel , max. 793K car). The relata of
these concepts (26,554 in total) are distributed as re-
ported in Table 1.
Note that the distributions reﬂect certain “natural”
differences between relations (hypernyms tend to be
more frequent words than coordinates, but there are

more coordinates than hypernyms, etc.). Instead of
trying to artiﬁcially control for these differences, we
assess their impact in Section 5 by looking at the
behavior of baselines that exploit the frequency and
cardinality of relations as proxies to semantic simi-
larity (such factors could also be entered as regres-
sors in a linear model).
5 Evaluation
This section illustrates one possible way to use
BLESS to explore and evaluate DSMs. Given the
similarity scores provided by a model for a concept
with all its relata across all relations, we pick the re-
latum with the highest score (nearest neighbour) for
each relation (see discussion in Section 3 above on
why we allow models to pick their favorite from a
set of relata instantiating the same relation). In this
way, for each of the 200 BLESS concepts, we obtain
8 similarity scores, one per relation. In order to fac-
tor out concept-speciﬁc effects that might add to the
overall score variance (for example, a frequent con-
cept might have a denser neighborhood than a rarer
one, and consequently the nearest relatum scores of
the former are trivially higher than those of the lat-
ter), we transform the 8 similarity scores of each
concept onto standardized zscores (mean: 0; s.d: 1)
by subtracting from each their mean, and dividing by
their standard deviation. After this transformation,
we produce a boxplot summarizing the distribution
of scores per relation across the 200 concepts (i.e.,each box of the plot summarizes the distribution of
the 200 standardized scores picked for each rela-
tion). Our boxplots (see examples in Fig. 1 below)
display the median of a distribution as a thick hori-
zontal line within a box extending from the ﬁrst to
the third quartile, with whiskers covering 1.5 of the
interquartile range in each direction from the box,
and values outside this extended range – extreme
outliers – plotted as circles (these are the default
boxplotting option of the R statistical package).3
While the boxplots are extremely informative about
the relation types that are best captured by models,
we expect some degree of overlap among the distri-
butions of different relations, and in such cases we
might want to ask whether a certain model assigns
signiﬁcantly higher scores to one relation rather than
another (for example, to coordinates rather than ran-
dom nouns ). It is difﬁcult to decide a priori which
pairwise statistical comparisons will be interesting.
We thus take a conservative approach in which we
perform allpairwise comparisons using the Tukey
Honestly Signiﬁcant Difference test, that is simi-
lar to the standard ttest, but accounts for the greater
likelihood of Type I errors when multiple compar-
isons are performed (Abdi and Williams, 2010). We
only report the Tukey test results for those com-
parisons that are of interest in the analysis of the
boxplots, using the standard α=0.05signiﬁcance
threshold.
5.1 Models
Occurrence and co-occurrence statistics for all mod-
els are extracted from the combined ukWaC and
Wackypedia corpora (see Section 4.4 above). We ex-
ploit the automated morphosyntactic annotation of
the corpora by building our DSMs out of lemmas
(instead of inﬂected words), and relying on part of
speech information.
Baselines. TheRelatumFrequency baseline uses
the frequency of occurrence of a relatum as a sur-
rogate of its cosine with the concept. With this ap-
proach, we want to verify that the unequal frequency
distribution across relations (see Table 1 above) is
not trivially sufﬁcient to differentiate relation classes
in a semantically interesting way. For our second
baseline, we assign a random number as cosine sur-
3http://www.r-project.org/ rogate to each relatum (to smooth these random val-
ues, we generate them by ﬁrst sampling, for each
relatum, 10K random variates from a uniform distri-
bution, and then averaging them). If the set of relata
instantiating a certain relation is larger, it is more
likely that it will contain the highest random value.
Thus, this RelationCardinality baseline will favor
relations that tend to have large relata set across con-
cepts, controlling for effects due to different cardi-
nalities across semantic relations (again, see Table 1
above).
DSMs. We choose a few ways to construct DSMs
for illustrative purposes only. All the models contain
vector representations for the same words, namely,
approximately, the top 20K most frequent nouns, 5K
most frequent adjectives and 5K most frequent verbs
in the combined corpora. All the models use Local
Mutual Information (Evert, 2005; Baroni and Lenci,
2010) to weight raw co-occurrence counts (this asso-
ciation measure is obtained by multiplying the raw
count by Pointwise Mutual Information, and it is a
close approximation to the Log-Likelihood Ratio).
Three DSMs are based on counting co-occurrences
with collocates within a window of ﬁxed width,
in the tradition of HAL (Lund and Burgess, 1996)
and many later models. The ContentWindow2
model records sentence-internal co-occurrence with
the nearest 2 content words to the left and right
of each target concept (the same 30K target nouns,
verbs and adjectives are also employed as context
content words). ContentWindow20 is like Con-
tentWindow2, but considers a larger window of 20
words to the left and right of the target. AllWin-
dow2 adopts the same window of ContentWindow2,
but considers all co-occurrences, not only those with
content words. The Document model, ﬁnally, is
based on a (Local-Mutual-Information transformed)
word-by-document matrix, recording the distribu-
tion of the 30K target words across the documents in
the concatenated corpus. This DSM is thus akin to
traditional Latent Semantic Analysis (Landauer and
Dumais, 1997), without dimensionality reduction.
The content-window-based models have, by con-
struction, about 30K dimensions. The other models
are much larger, and for practical reasons we only
keep 1 million dimensions (those that account, cu-

5.2 Results
The concept-by-concept z-normalized distributions
of cosines of relata instantiating each of our rela-
tions are presented, for each of the example mod-
els, in Fig. 1. The RelatumFrequency baseline
shows a preference for adjectives and verbs in gen-
eral, independently of whether they are meaningful
(attributes, events) or not (random adjectives and
verbs), reﬂecting the higher frequencies of adjec-
tives and verbs in BLESS (Table 1). The Relation-
Cardinality baseline produces even less interesting
results, with a strong preference for random nouns,
followed by coordinates, events and random verbs
(as predicted by the distribution in Table 1). We can
conclude that the semantically meaningful patterns
produced by the other models cannot be explained
by trivial differences in relatum frequency or rela-
tion cardinality in the BLESS data set.
Moving then to the real DSMs, ContentWindow2
essentially partitions the relations into 3 groups: co-
ordinates are the closest relata, which makes sense
since they are, taxonomically, the most similar en-
tities to target concepts. They are followed by (but
signiﬁcantly closer to the concept than) events, hy-
pernyms and meronyms (events and hypernyms sig-
niﬁcantly above meronyms). Next come the at-
tributes (signiﬁcantly lower cosines than all relation
types above). All the meaningful relata are signif-
icantly closer to the concepts than the random re-
lata. Similar patterns can be observed in the Con-
tentWindow20 distribution, however in this case the
events, while still signiﬁcantly below the coordi-
nates, are signiﬁcantly above the (statistically in-
distinguishable) hypernym, meronym and attribute
set. Again, all meaningful relata are above the ran-
dom ones. Both content-window-based models pro-
vide reasonable results, with ContentWindow2 be-
ing probably closer to our “ontological” intuitions.
The high ranking of events is probably explained
by the fact that a nominal concept will often ap-
pear as subject or object of verbs expressing asso-
ciated events ( dog barks ,ﬁshing tuna ), and thus the
corresponding verbs will share even relatively nar-
row context windows with the concept noun. The
AllWindow2 distribution probably reﬂects the fact
that many contexts picked by this DSM are function ●●●●

  <conclusion>We introduced BLESS, the ﬁrst data set speciﬁcallydesigned for the intrinsic evaluation of DSMs. Thedata set contains tuples instantiating different, ex-plicitly typed semantic relations, plus a number ofcontrolled random tuples. Thus, BLESS can be usedto evaluate both the ability of DSMs to discriminatetruly related word pairs, and to perform in-depthanalyses of the types of semantic relata that differentmodels tend to favor among the nearest neighbors ofa target concept. Even a simple comparison of theperformance of a few DSMs on BLESS - like theone we have shown here - is able to highlight inter-esting differences in the semantic spaces producedby the various models. The success of BLESS willobviously depend on whether it will become a refer-ence model for the evaluation of DSMs, somethingthat can not be foreseena priori. Whatever its des-tiny, we believe that the BLESS approach can boostand innovate evaluation in distributional semantics,as a key condition to get at a deeper understandingof its potentialities as a viable model for meaning.9</conclusion>

  <abstract>This work is concerned with distinguishing different semantic relations which exist between
distributionally similar words. We compare a novel approach based on training a linear Support
Vector Machine on pairs of feature vectors with state-of-the-art methods based on distributional
similarity. We show that the new supervised approach does better even when there is minimal
information about the target words in the training data, giving a 15% reduction in error rate over
unsupervised approaches.</abstract>
  <introduction>
Over recent years there has been much interest in the ﬁeld of distributional semantics, drawing on the
distributional hypothesis: words that occur in similar contexts tend to have similar meanings (Harris,
1954). There is a large body of work on the use of different similarity measures (Lee, 1999; Weeds and
Weir, 2003; Curran, 2004) and many researchers have built thesauri (i.e. lists of “nearest neighbours”)
automatically and applied them in a variety of applications, generally with a good deal of success.
In early research there was much interest in how these automatically generated thesauri compare with
human-constructed gold standards such as WordNet and Roget (Lin, 1998; Kilgarriff and Yallop, 2000).
More recently, the focus has tended to shift to building thesauri to alleviate the sparse-data problem. Dis-
tributional thesauri have been used in a wide variety of areas including sentiment classiﬁcation (Bollegala
et al., 2011), WSD (Miller et al., 2012; Khapra et al., 2010), textual entailment (Berant et al., 2010), pre-
dicting semantic compositionality (Bergsma et al., 2010), acquisition of semantic lexicons (McIntosh,
2010), conversation entailment (Zhang and Chai, 2010), lexical substitution (Szarvas et al., 2013), tax-
onomy induction (Fountain and Lapata, 2012), and parser lexicalisation (Rei and Briscoe, 2013).
A primary focus of distributional semantics has been on identifying words which are similar to each
other. However, semantic similarity encompasses a variety of different lexico-semantic and topical re-
lations. Even if we just consider nouns, an automatically generated thesaurus will tend to return a mix
of synonyms, antonyms, hyponyms, hypernyms, co-hyponyms, meronyms and other topically related
words. A central problem here is that whilst most measures of distributional similarity are symmetric,
some of the important semantic relations are not. The hyponymy relation (and converse hypernymy)
which forms the ISA backbone of taxonomies and ontologies such as WordNet (Fellbaum, 1989), and
determines lexical entailment (Geffet and Dagan, 2005), is asymmetric. On the other hand, the co-
hyponymy relation which relates two words unrelated by hyponymy but sharing a (close) hypernym, is
symmetric, as are synonymy and antonymy. Table 1 shows the distributionally nearest neighbours of the
words cat,animal anddog. In the list for cat we can see 2 hypernyms and 13 co-hyponyms1.
1We read cat in the sense domestic cat rather than big cat , hence tiger is a co-hyponym rather than hyponym
ofcat.

Table 1: Top 15 neighbours of cat,animal anddog generated using Lin’s similarity measure (Lin,
1998) considering all words and dependency features occurring 100 or more times in Wikipedia.
Distributional similarity is being deployed (e.g., Dinu and Thater (2012)) in situations where it can
be useful to be able to distinguish between these different relationships. Consider the following two
sentences.
The cat ran across the road. (1)
The animal ran across the road. (2)
Sentence 1 textually entails sentence 2, but sentence 2 does not textually entail sentence 1. The ability
to determine whether entailment holds between the sentences, and in which direction, depends on the
ability to identify hyponymy. Given a similarity score of 0.29 between cat andanimal , how do we
know which is the hyponym and which is the hypernym?
In applying distributional semantics to the problem of textual entailment, there is a need to generalise
lexical entailment to phrases and sentences. Thus, the ability to distinguish different semantic relations
is crucial if approaches to the composition of distributional representations of meaning that are currently
receiving considerable interest (Widdows, 2008; Mitchell and Lapata, 2008; Baroni and Zamparelli,
2010; Grefenstette et al., 2011; Socher et al., 2012; Weeds et al., 2014) are to be applied to the textual
entailment problem.
We formulate the challenge as follows: Consider a set of pairs of similar words /angbracketleftA, B/angbracketrightwhere one of
three relationships hold between AandB:Alexically entails B,Blexically entails AorAandBare
related by co-hyponymy. Given such a set, how can we determine which relationship holds? In Section
2, we discuss existing attempts to address this problem through the use of various directional measures
of distributional similarity.
This paper considers the effectiveness of various supervised approaches, and makes the following
contributions. First, we show that a SVM can distinguish the entailment and co-hyponymy relations,
achieving a signiﬁcant reduction in error rate in comparison to existing state-of-the-art methods based
on the notion of distributional generality. Second, by comparing two different data sets, one built from
BLESS (Baroni and Lenci, 2011) and the other from WordNet (Fellbaum, 1989), we derive important
insights into the requirements of a valid evaluation of supervised approaches, and provide a data set
for further research in this area. Third, we show that when learning how to determine an ontological
relationship between a pair of similar words by means of the word’s distributional vectors, quite different
vector operations are useful when identifying different ontological relationships. In particular, using the
difference between the vectors for pairs of words is appropriate for the entailment task, whereas adding
the vectors works well for the co-hyponym task.
</introduction>
  <corps>Lee (1999) noted that the substitutability of one word for another was asymmetric and proposed the
alpha-skew divergence measure, an asymmetric version of the Kullback-Leibler divergence measure. She
found that this measure improved results in language modelling, when a word’s distribution is smoothed
using the distributions of its nearest neighbours.
Weeds et al. (2004) proposed a notion of distributional generality, observing that more general words
tend to occur in a larger variety of contexts than more speciﬁc words. For example, we would expect to be
able to replace any occurrence of cat withanimal and so all of the contexts of cat must be plausible2250contexts for animal . However, not all of the contexts of animal would be plausible for cat, e.g.,
“the monstrous animal barked at the intruder”. Weeds et al. (2004) attempt to capture this asymmetry
by framing word similarity in terms of co-occurrence retrieval (Weeds and Weir, 2003), where precision
and recall are deﬁned as:
Pww(u, v) =Σf∈F(u)∩F(v)I(u, f)
Σf∈F(u)I(u, f)andRww(u, v) =Σf∈F(u)∩F(v)I(v, f)
Σf∈F(v)I(v, f)
where I(n, f)is the pointwise mutual information (PMI) between noun nand feature fand F(n) is the
set of all features ffor which I(n, f)&gt;0.
By comparing the precision and recall of one word’s retrieval of another word’s contexts, they were
able to successfully identify the direction of an entailment relation in 71% of pairs drawn from WordNet.
However, this was not signiﬁcantly better than a baseline which proposed that the most frequent word
was the most general.
Clarke (2009) formalised the idea of distributional generality using a partially ordered vector space.
He also argued for using a variation of co-occurrence retrieval where precision and recall are deﬁned as:
Pcl(u, v) =Σf∈F(u)∩F(v)min(I(u, f), I(v, f))
Σf∈F(u)I(u, f)andRcl(u, v) =Σf∈F(u)∩F(v)min(I(u, f), I(v, f))
Σf∈F(v)I(v, f)
Lenci and Benotto (2012) took the notion further and hypothesised that more general terms should
have high recall and low precision, which would thus make it possible to distinguish them from other
related terms such as synonyms and co-hyponyms. They proposed a variant of the Clarke (2009) measure
to identify hypernyms:
invCL (u, v) =2/radicalBig
Pcl(u, v)∗(1−Rcl(u, v))
Evaluation on the BLESS data set (Baroni and Lenci, 2011), showed that this measure is better at distin-
guishing hypernyms from other relations than the measures of Weeds et al. (2004) and Clarke (2009).
Geffet and Dagan (2005) proposed an approach based on feature inclusion , which extends the rationale
of Weeds et al. (2004) to lexical entailment. Using data from the web they demonstrated a strong cor-
relation between complete inclusion of prominent features and lexical entailment. However, they were
unable to assess this using an off-line corpus due to data sparseness.
Szpektor and Dagan (2008) found that the Pwwmeasure tends to promote relationships between infre-
quent words with narrow vectors (i.e. those with relatively few distinct context features). They proposed
using the geometric average of Pwwand the symmetric similarity measure of Lin (1998) in order to
penalise low frequency words.
Kotlerman et al. (2010) apply the IR evaluation method of Average Precision to the problem of identi-
fying lexical inference and use the balancing approach of Szpektor and Dagan (2008) to demote similar-
ities for narrow feature vectors; their measure is called balAPinc . They show that all of the asymmetric
similarity measures previously proposed perform much better than symmetric similarity measures on
a directionality detection experiment, and that their method and that of Clarke (2009) outperform the
others with statistical signiﬁcance. They also show that their measure is superior when used for term
expansion in an event detection task.
Baroni et al. (2012) investigate the relation between phrasal and lexical entailment, and demonstrate
that support vector machines can generalise entailment relations between quantiﬁer phrases to entailment
involving unseen quantiﬁers. They compare the performance of their system with the balAPinc measure.
The Stanford WordNet project (Snow et al., 2004) expands the WordNet taxonomy by analysing large
corpora to ﬁnd patterns that are indicative of hyponymy. For example, the pattern “ NPXand other NPY”
is an indication that NPXis aNPY, i.e. that NPXis a hyponym of NPY. They use machine learning
to identify other such patterns from known hyponym-hypernym pairs, and then use these patterns to ﬁnd
new relations in the corpus. The transitivity relation of the taxonomy is enforced by searching only over
valid taxonomies and evaluating the likelihood of each taxonomy given the available evidence (Snow2251et al., 2006). The approach is similar to ours in providing a supervised method of learning semantic
relations, but relies on having features for occurrences of pairs of terms rather than just vectors for terms
themselves. Our approach is therefore more generally applicable to systems which compose distribu-
tional representations of meaning.
Most recently, Rei and Briscoe (2013) note that hyponyms are well suited for lexical substitution.
In their experiments with smoothing edge scores for parser lexicalisation, they ﬁnd that a directional
similarity measure, WeightedCosine2, performs best. Also of note, Mikolov et al. (2013) propose a vector
offset method to capture syntactic and semantic regularities between word representations learnt by a
recurrent neural network language model. Yih et al. (2012) present a method for distinguishing synonyms
and antonyms by inducing polarity in a document-term matrix before applying Latent Semantic Analysis.
Santus et al. (2014) propose identifying hypernyms using a new measure based on entropy, SLQS, which
is based on the hypothesis that the most typical linguistic contexts of a hypernym are less informative
than the most typical linguistic contexts of its hyponyms. Evaluated on pairs extracted from the BLESS
dataset (Baroni and Lenci, 2011), this measure outperforms Pwwat both discriminating hypernym test
pairs from other types of relation and at determining the direction of the entailment relation.
3 Methodology
The code used to perform our experiments has been open sourced, and is available online.3
3.1 Vector Representations
Distributional information was collected for all of the nouns from Wikipedia provided they had oc-
curred 100or more times. We used a Wikimedia dump of Wikipedia from June 2011 and extracted
text using wp2txt4. This was part-of-speech tagged, lemmatised and dependency parsed using the Malt
Parser (Nivre, 2004). All major grammatical dependency relations involving open class parts of speech
(nsubj, dobj, iobj, conj, amod, nnmod ) and also occurring 100or more times were ex-
tracted as features of the POS-tagged and lemmatised nouns. The value of each feature is the positive
point wise mutual information (PPMI) (Church and Hanks, 1989) between the noun and the feature. The
total number of noun vectors which can be harvested from Wikipedia with these parameters is 124,345.
Our goal is to build classiﬁers that establish whether or not a given semantic relation, rel, holds be-
tween two similar words AandB. Support vector machines (SVMs), which are effective across a variety
of classiﬁcation scenarios, learn a boundary between two classes from a set of positive and negative ex-
ample vectors. The two classes correspond to the relation relholding or not holding. Here, however, we
do not start with a single vector, but with two distributional vectors vAandvBfor the words AandB,
respectively. These vectors must be combined in some way to produce the SVM’s input, and a number
of ways were considered, deﬁned in Table 2. Of these operations, the vector difference (used by svm-
DIFF andknnDIFF ) and direct sum (used by svmCAT ) are asymmetric, whereas the sum and pointwise
multiplication (used by svmADD andsvmMULT ) are symmetric.
We now motivate the use of each of these operations. First, we note that pointwise multiplication
(svmMULT ) is intersective. Similar vectors will have a large intersection and it might be possible to
learn the features that nouns occurring in different semantic relations should share. However, it does
not retain any information about non-shared features and it is symmetric so it is difﬁcult to see how it
would be possible to use it to distinguish hypernyms from hyponyms. Pointwise addition ( svmADD )
effectively performs the union of the features, giving emphasis to the shared features. Whilst it does
retain information about the non-shared features, it is also symmetric, making it difﬁcult again to see
how it would be useful in determining the direction of an entailment relation
Vector difference (as used in svmDIFF andknnDIFF ), on the other hand, is asymmetric. Further,
we might expect a small difference vector (containing many zeroes) to be indicative of similar nouns.
Further, considering the majority sign of features in this difference vector might indicate the direction of
2The details of this measure are unpublished.

4https://github.com/yohasebe/wp2txt2252entailment. Using an SVM, we might expect to be able to effectively learn which of these features should
be ignored and which should be combined, to decide the correct direction of entailment in the majority
number of cases in our training data. However, note that if one uses vector difference it is impossible to
distinguish between the case where a feature occurred with both nouns (to the same extent) and the case
where a feature occurs with neither noun. Accordingly, a small difference vector may indicate that both
nouns do not occur in many distinct contexts. A possible solution to this problem is to use the direct
sum of the vectors (i.e., the concatenation of the two vectors) which retains all of the information from
the original vectors. Finally, we consider the use of the single vector corresponding to the second word
(svmSING ) as a baseline. High performance by this operation would indicate that we can learn features
of words which tend to be hypernyms (or co-hyponyms) without any regard to the other word in the
putative relationship.
We also note that the behaviour of these methods may differ depending on the weighting used for vec-
tors. For example, PMI is the log of a ratio of probabilities and therefore one might expect vector addition
where vectors are weighted using PMI to correspond to multiplication where vectors are weighted using
frequency or probability. However, the use of positive PMI (where negative PMI scores are regarded
equal to zero), which is consistent with other work in this area, means that this correspondence is lost.
Because of the nature of our datasets, we were concerned that systems could learn information about
the taxonomy from the relations in the training data, without making use of information in the vectors
themselves. To investigate this, we constructed random vectors to be used in place of the vectors derived
from Wikipedia. The dimensionality of the random vectors was chosen to be 1000 since this substantially
exceeds the average number ( 398) of non-zero features in the Wikipedia vectors.
3.2 Classiﬁers
We constructed linear SVMs for each of the vector operations outlined in Section 3.1. We used linear
SVMs for speed and simplicity, since the point is to compare the different vector representations of
the pairings. For comparison, we also constructed a number of supervised, unsupervised, and weakly
supervised classiﬁers. These are listed in Table 2. For the linear SVMs and kNN classiﬁer, we used the
scikit-learn implementations with default settings. For knearest neighbours, we performed a parameter
search, using nested cross-validation, varying kbetween 1 and 50.
For weakly supervised approaches, we evaluated the measure on the training set, then found the best
threshold pon the training set that best divides the two classes using that measure. When classifying, we
determine that the relation holds if the value of the measure exceeds p.

Table 2: Implemented classiﬁers22533.3 Data Sets
One of key the challenges of this work has been to construct a data set which accurately and validly tests
our hypotheses. All four of our datasets detailed below are available online5.
In order to test our hypotheses, a data set needs to be balanced in many respects in order to prevent the
supervised classiﬁers making use of artefacts of the data. This would not only make it unfair to compare
the supervised approaches with the unsupervised approaches, but also make it unlikely that our results
would be generalisable to other data. Here, we outline the requirements for the data sets, the importance
of which is demonstrated by our initial results for a data set which does not satisfy all of them.
There should be an equal number of positive and negative examples of a semantic relation. Thus,
random guessing or labelling with the most frequently seen label in the training data will yield 50%
accuracy and precision. An advantage of incorporating this requirement means that evaluation can be in
terms of simple accuracy (or error rate).
It should not be possible to do well simply by considering the distributional similarity of the terms.
Hence, the negative examples need to be pairs of equally similar words, but where the relationship under
consideration does not hold.
It should not be possible to do well by pre-supposing an entailment relation and guessing the direction.
For example, it has been shown (Weeds et al., 2004) that given a pair of entailing words selected from
WordNet, over 70% of the time the more frequent word is also the entailed word.
It should not be possible to do well using ontological information learnt about one or both of the
words from the training data that is not generalisable to their distributional representations. For example,
it should not be possible for the classiﬁer simply to learn directly from the training pairs /angbracketleftcat ISA
mammal/angbracketrightand/angbracketleftmammal ISAanimal/angbracketrightthat/angbracketleftcat ISAanimal/angbracketright. Furthermore, we must ensure that
a classiﬁer cannot learn that a particular word is near the top of the ontological hierarchy, and, as a
result, do well by guessing that a particular pairing probably has an entailment relation. For example,
given many pairs such as /angbracketleftcat ISAanimal/angbracketright,/angbracketleftdog ISAanimal/angbracketright, a system which guessed /angbracketleftrabbit
ISAanimal/angbracketrightbut not/angbracketleftanimal ISArabbit/angbracketrightwould do better than random guessing. Whilst both
of these types of information could be useful in a hybrid system, they do not require any distributional
information and therefore we would not be learning anything about the distributional features of animal
which make it likely to be a hypernym.
3.3.1 BLESS
We have constructed two data sets from BLESS (Baroni and Lenci, 2011) which is a collection of ex-
amples of hypernyms, co-hyponyms, meronyms and random unrelated words for each of 200concrete,
largely monosemous nouns. We will refer to these 200nouns as the BLESS concepts.
hyponymBLESS is a set of 1976 labelled pairs of nouns. For each BLESS concept, 80% of the hypernyms
were randomly selected to provide positive examples of entailment. The remaining hypernyms for the
given concept were reversed and taken with the same number of co-hyponyms, meronyms and random
words to form negative examples of entailment. A ﬁlter was applied to ensure that duplicate pairs were
not included (e.g., if /angbracketleftcat,animal/angbracketrightis a positive pair then /angbracketleftanimal ,cat/angbracketrightcannot be a negative pair).
cohyponymBLESS is a set of 5835 labelled pairs of nouns. For each BLESS concept, the co-hyponyms
were taken as positive examples of this relation. The same total number of (and split evenly between)
hypernyms, meronyms and random words was taken to form the negative examples. The order of 50%
of the pairs was reversed and again duplicate pairs were disallowed.
In both cases the pairs are labelled as positive or negative for the speciﬁed semantic relation and in
both cases there are equal ( ±1) numbers of positive and negative examples. For 99% of the generated
BLESS pairs, both nouns had associated vectors harvested from Wikipedia. If a noun does not have an
associated vector, the classiﬁers use a zero vector.
5https://github.com/SussexCompSem/learninghypernyms22543.3.2 WordNet
We constructed two data sets using WordNet. Whilst these data sets are similar in size to the BLESS
data sets they more adequately satisfy the requirements laid out above6. We constructed a list of all non-
rare, largely monosemous, single word terms in WordNet. To be considered non-rare, a word needed to
have occurred in SemCor at least once (i.e. frequency information is provided about it in the WordNet
package) and to have occurred in Wikipedia at least 100times. To be considered largely monosemous,
the predominant sense of the word needed to account for over 50% of the occurrences in the SemCor
frequency information provided with WordNet. This led to a list of 7613 nouns.
hyponymWNis a set of 2564 labelled pairs of nouns constructed in the following way. Pairs /angbracketleftA, B/angbracketrightwere
found in the list of nouns where Bis an ancestor of A(i.e.,Alexically entails B). Each found pair is
added either as a positive or a negative in the ratio 2:1 provided that the reverse pairing has not already
been added and provided that each word has not previously been used in that position. Co-hyponym
pairs (i.e., words which share a direct hypernym) were also found within the list of nouns. Each found
pair is added to the data set (as a negative) provided the reverse pairing has not already been added, and
provided that neither word has already been seen in that position in a pairing (either in the entailment
pairs or the co-hyponym pairs). The same number of co-hyponym pairs as hypernym-hyponym negatives
is selected. This provides a balanced data set where half of the pairs are positive examples of entailment
and the other half are semantically similar but not entailing.
cohyponymWNis a set of 3771 labelled pairs of nouns. It was constructed in the same way as hyponymWN
except the same number of co-hyponym pairs were selected as the total number of entailment pairs (in
either direction). These co-hyponym pairs were labelled as positive and the entailment pairs were labelled
as negative. Thus, this provides a balanced data set where half of the pairs are positive examples of co-
hyponyms and the other half, the negative examples, are entailment pairs (with direction unspeciﬁed)
In both these sets, the average path distance between entailment pairs is 1.64, whereas path distance
between co-hyponym pairs is 2.
3.4 Experimental Setup
Most of our experiments were carried out using an implementation of ﬁve-fold cross-validation using
each combination of data set, vector set and classiﬁer. In this setup, the pairs are randomly partitioned
into ﬁve subsets, one subset is held out for testing whilst the classiﬁers are trained on the remaining four,
and this process is repeated using each subset as the test set.
In initial experiments with the BLESS datasets, the SVM classiﬁers were able to achieve classiﬁcation
accuracy of over 95% for hyponymBLESS and over 90% for cohyponymBLESS . However, the results us-
ing random vectors were not signiﬁcantly different from using the distributional vectors harvested from
Wikipedia. This indicated that the classiﬁers were learning ontological information implicit in the train-
ing data. In order to address this, when using the BLESS datasets, we removed any pair from the training
data if either word was present in the test data. In order to preserve a reasonable amount of training data,
we implemented this approach with ten-fold cross-validation. In all subsequent experiments, across all
datasets and classiﬁers, we found performance by the random vectors was no higher than 52%. This
indicates that the performance seen in Table 3 is due to learning from distributional features rather than
any ontological information implicit in the training set.
4 Results
In Table 3, we compare average accuracy for a number of different classiﬁers on each of two tasks,
distinguishing hyponyms and distinguishing co-hyponyms, on each of the two datasets.
Looking at the results for the hyponymBLESS data set, we can see that the SVM methods do generally
outperform the unsupervised methods. However, the best performing model is svmSING, suggesting
that, for this data set, it is best to try to learn the distributional features of more general terms, rather than
comparing the vector representations of the two terms under consideration.
6Note that imposing these requirements on the BLESS data sets would lead to very small data sets, since information is only
provided for 200nouns.2255dataset svmDIFF svmMULT svmADD svmCAT svmSING knnDIFF

0.02). For cohyponyms, results for measures designed to detect hyponymy have been omitted. We also
omit results of clarkediff as these were consistently the same or less than CRdiff.
On the corresponding co-hyponym task, using the cohyponymBLESS data set, we see the best performing
classiﬁer is the cosine measure. The cosine measure is able to perform relatively well here because a
substantial proportion of the negative examples (25%) are random unrelated words which will have low
cosine scores. It is also consistent with earlier work (e.g., (Lenci and Benotto, 2012)) which suggests
that measures such as the cosine measure “prefer” words in symmetric semantic relationships such as co-
hyponymy. The poor performance of the SVM methods here can perhaps be explained by the paucity of
the training data in this experimental set up with this data set. If, for example, our test concept is robin ,
our approach requires that we will not have any training pairs containing robin , or any training pairs
containing any of the words to which robin is related in the test set. In a dataset as small as BLESS,
this requirement effectively removes all knowledge of the distributional features of words in the target
domain. Hence, the need for a larger dataset as we have extracted from WordNet.
Looking at the results for the hyponymWNdata set, the directional SVM methods ( svmDIFF andsvm-
CAT) substantially outperform the symmetric SVM methods, and their performance is signiﬁcantly better
(at the 0.01% level) than the unsupervised methods. Also of note is the substantial difference between
svmDIFF andknnDIFF . Both of these methods are trained on the differences of vectors. However, the
linear SVM outperforms kNN by 19–25%. This may suggest that the shape of the vector space inhabited
by the positive entailment pairs is particularly conducive for learning a linear SVM. Positive and negative
pairs are close together (as evidenced by the poor performance of kNN), but generally linearly separable.
Looking at the results for the cohyponymWNdata set, it is clear that the unsupervised methods cannot
distinguish the co-hyponym pairs from the entailing pairs. The supervised SVM methods do substantially
better, with the best performance achieved by svmADD andsvmCAT . Both of these methods essentially
retain information about all of the features of both words. svmMULT does much better than svmDIFF ,
which suggests that the shared features are more indicative than the non-shared features for this task.
The reasonably high performance of svmSING on both data sets suggests that words which have co-
hyponyms in the data set tend to inhabit a somewhat different part of the feature space to words which
are included as entailed words in the data set. We hypothesise that there are speciﬁc features which more
general words tend to share (regardless of their topic) which makes it possible to identify more general
words from more speciﬁc words. This is completely consistent with very recent results using SLQS, a
new entropy-based measure (Santus et al., 2014). Here, the authors hypothesise that the most typical
contexts of a hypernym are less informative than the most typical linguistic contexts of its hyponyms,
with some promising results. It would be plausible to hypothesise that svmSING is learning which nouns
typically have less informative contexts and are therefore likely to by hypernyms.
Given prior work, the performance of the balAPincP measure is lower than expected on the
hyponymWNdataset. Our task is slightly different to that of (Kotlerman et al., 2010), since we are deter-
mining the existence (or not) of hyponymy, rather than the direction of entailment for pairs where it is</corps>
  <conclusion>We have shown that it is possible to predict to a large extent whether or not there is a speciﬁc semantic
relation between two words given their distributional vectors, using a supervised approach based on
linear SVMs. The increase in accuracy over unsupervised methods is signiﬁcant at the 0.01% level and
corresponds to a substantial absolute reduction in error rate (over 15%).
We have also shown that the choice of vector operation is signiﬁcant. Whilst concatenating the vectors,
and therefore retaining all of the information from both vectors including direction, generally performs
well, we have also shown that different vector operations are useful in establishing different relationships.
In particular, the vector difference operation, which loses information about the original vectors, achieved
performance indistinguishable from concatenation on the entailment task, where the classiﬁer is required
to distinguish hyponyms from other semantically related words including hypernyms. On the other
hand, the addition operation, which also loses information, outperformed concatenation by 4% (which
is statistically signiﬁcant at the 0.01% level) on the coordinate task, where the classiﬁer is required to
distinguish co-hyponyms from hyponyms and hypernyms. Hence the nature of the relationship one is
trying to establish between words determines the nature of the operation one should perform on their
associated vectors.
We have also shown that it is possible to outperform state-of-the-art unsupervised methods even when
a data set has been constructed without ontological information, and when target words have not previ-
ously been seen in that position of a relationship in the training data. Hence, we believe the supervised
methods are learning characteristics of the underlying feature space which are generalisable to new words
(inhabiting the same feature space).
In future work, we intend to apply this approach to the problem of labelling the distributional neigh-
bours found for a given word with speciﬁc semantic relations. We also plan to investigate the use of
bag-of-words (windowed) vectors instead of grammatical relations for this task.
Finally, we believe that the data sets constructed from WordNet, which we publish alongside this
paper, can be used as a useful benchmark in evaluating future advances in this area, both for supervised
and unsupervised methods.</conclusion>

  <abstract> Unsupervise learned word embeddings have seen
tremendous success in numerous Natural Language Processing
(NLP) tasks in recent years. The main contribution of this
paper is to develop a technique called Skill2vec, which applies
machine learning techniques in recruitment to enhance the
search strategy to ﬁnd candidates possessing the appropriate
skills. Skill2vec is a neural network architecture inspired by
Word2vec, developed by Mikolov et al. in 2013. It transforms
skills to new vector space, which has the characteristics of
calculation and presents skills relationships. We conducted an
experiment evaluation manually by a recruitment company’s
domain experts to demonstrate the effectiveness of our ap-
proach.

  <introduction>
Recruiters in information technology domain have met the
problem ﬁnding appropriate candidates by their skills. In the
resume, the candidate may describe one skill in different
ways or skills could be replaced by others. The recruiters
may not have the domain knowledge to know if one’s skills
are ﬁt or not, so they can only ﬁnd ones with matched skills.
In order to cope with the problem, one should try to
ﬁnd the relatedness of skills. There are some approaches:
building a dictionary manually, ontology approach, natural
language processing methods, etc. In this study, we apply a
word embedding method Word2Vec, using skills from online
job post descriptions. We treat skills as terms, job posts as
documents and ﬁnd the relatedness of these skills.
II. RELATED WORK
To ﬁnd relatedness of skills, Simon Hughes [4] from Dice
proposed an approach using Latent Semantic Analysis with
an assumption that skills are related to skills which occur
in the same context, and here contexts are job posts. This
approach will build a term-document matrix and use Singular
Value Decomposition to reduce the dimensionality. The cons
of this approach is that when we have new data coming, we
can not update the old term-document matrix, this leads to
difﬁculties in maintaining the model, as the change of trend
in this domain is high.
Google’s Data Scientists also face the same problems
in Cloud Jobs API [7]. Their solution is to build a skill
ontology deﬁning around 50,000 skills in 30 job domain with
relationships such as is a, related to, etc. This approach can
represent complicate relationships between skills and jobs,
but building such an ontology costs so much time and effort.
To overcome the problem of relevant term, [3] present a
new, effective log-based approach to relevant term extraction
and term suggestion.The goal of [2] is to develop an automated system that
discovers additional names for an entity given just one of
its names, using Latent semantic analysis (LSA) [1]. In the
example of authors, the city in India referred to as Bombay
in some documents may be referred to as Mumbai in others
because its name ofﬁcially changed from the former to the
latter in 1995.
[5] is the introduction of an ontology-based skills man-
agement system at Swiss Life and the lessons learned from
the utilisation of the methodology, present a methodology
for application-driven development of ontologies that is
instantiated by a case study.
III. WORD2VEC ARCHITECTURE
Word2Vec is a group of models proposed by Mikolov et al
in 2013 [6]. It consists of 2 models: continuous bag-of-words
and continuous Skip-gram, both are shallow neural networks
that try to learn distributed representations of words with
the target is to maximize the accuracy while minimizing the
computational complexity. In the continuous bag-of-words
architecture, the model predicts the current word from a
window of surrounding context words. On the other hand,
Skip-gram model try to predict surrounding context words
based on the current word. In this work, we focus on Skip-
gram model as it is known to be better with infrequent words
and it also give slightly better result in our experiment.
The model consists of three layers: input layer, one hidden
layer and output layer. The input layer take a word encoded
using 1-of-V encoding (also known as one-hot encoding),
where V is size of the dictionary. The word is then fed
through the linear hidden layer to the output layer, which
is a softmax classiﬁer. The output layer will try to predict
words within window size before and after current word.
Using stochastic gradient descent and back propagation, we
train the model until it converges.
This model takes vector dimensionality and window size
as parameters. The author found that increasing the window
size improves the quality of the word vector, and yet it
increases the computational complexity.
IV. M ETHODOLOGY
A. Data collecting and processing
Choosing a universal data set for the model is extremely
important, the data should be large enough and should have
balanced distributions over words (i.e. skills).arXiv:1707.09751v3  [cs.CL]  9 Oct 2019There are two dataset we need to concern, one (1) is the
standard skills dictionary for the parser and another (2) is
skills for training model; follow the ﬁgure 1.

First, we collected and prepared a large dictionary of
skills. With this dictionary, we can extract a set of skills
from raw job descriptions. Skillss need to be cleaned into
unique skills because there are many way to present a skill in
job description ( i.e. OOP or Object-oriented programming ).

After that, we had the dictionary of skills ready for

about Tech jobs in USA. From these job descriptions, we
extract skills for each one by using our skills dictionary

skills in the same job description. The dataset is published

VI. </introduction>
  <corps>Recruiters in information technology domain have met the
problem ﬁnding appropriate candidates by their skills. In the
resume, the candidate may describe one skill in different
ways or skills could be replaced by others. The recruiters
may not have the domain knowledge to know if one’s skills
are ﬁt or not, so they can only ﬁnd ones with matched skills.
In order to cope with the problem, one should try to
ﬁnd the relatedness of skills. There are some approaches:
building a dictionary manually, ontology approach, natural
language processing methods, etc. In this study, we apply a
word embedding method Word2Vec, using skills from online
job post descriptions. We treat skills as terms, job posts as
documents and ﬁnd the relatedness of these skills.
II. RELATED WORK
To ﬁnd relatedness of skills, Simon Hughes [4] from Dice
proposed an approach using Latent Semantic Analysis with
an assumption that skills are related to skills which occur
in the same context, and here contexts are job posts. This
approach will build a term-document matrix and use Singular
Value Decomposition to reduce the dimensionality. The cons
of this approach is that when we have new data coming, we
can not update the old term-document matrix, this leads to
difﬁculties in maintaining the model, as the change of trend
in this domain is high.
Google’s Data Scientists also face the same problems
in Cloud Jobs API [7]. Their solution is to build a skill
ontology deﬁning around 50,000 skills in 30 job domain with
relationships such as is a, related to, etc. This approach can
represent complicate relationships between skills and jobs,
but building such an ontology costs so much time and effort.
To overcome the problem of relevant term, [3] present a
new, effective log-based approach to relevant term extraction
and term suggestion.The goal of [2] is to develop an automated system that
discovers additional names for an entity given just one of
its names, using Latent semantic analysis (LSA) [1]. In the
example of authors, the city in India referred to as Bombay
in some documents may be referred to as Mumbai in others
because its name ofﬁcially changed from the former to the
latter in 1995.
[5] is the introduction of an ontology-based skills man-
agement system at Swiss Life and the lessons learned from
the utilisation of the methodology, present a methodology
for application-driven development of ontologies that is
instantiated by a case study.
III. WORD2VEC ARCHITECTURE
Word2Vec is a group of models proposed by Mikolov et al
in 2013 [6]. It consists of 2 models: continuous bag-of-words
and continuous Skip-gram, both are shallow neural networks
that try to learn distributed representations of words with
the target is to maximize the accuracy while minimizing the
computational complexity. In the continuous bag-of-words
architecture, the model predicts the current word from a
window of surrounding context words. On the other hand,
Skip-gram model try to predict surrounding context words
based on the current word. In this work, we focus on Skip-
gram model as it is known to be better with infrequent words
and it also give slightly better result in our experiment.
The model consists of three layers: input layer, one hidden
layer and output layer. The input layer take a word encoded
using 1-of-V encoding (also known as one-hot encoding),
where V is size of the dictionary. The word is then fed
through the linear hidden layer to the output layer, which
is a softmax classiﬁer. The output layer will try to predict
words within window size before and after current word.
Using stochastic gradient descent and back propagation, we
train the model until it converges.
This model takes vector dimensionality and window size
as parameters. The author found that increasing the window
size improves the quality of the word vector, and yet it
increases the computational complexity.
IV. M ETHODOLOGY
A. Data collecting and processing
Choosing a universal data set for the model is extremely
important, the data should be large enough and should have
balanced distributions over words (i.e. skills).arXiv:1707.09751v3  [cs.CL]  9 Oct 2019There are two dataset we need to concern, one (1) is the
standard skills dictionary for the parser and another (2) is
skills for training model; follow the ﬁgure 1.

First, we collected and prepared a large dictionary of
skills. With this dictionary, we can extract a set of skills
from raw job descriptions. Skillss need to be cleaned into
unique skills because there are many way to present a skill in
job description ( i.e. OOP or Object-oriented programming ).

extract skills for each one by using our skills dictionary

  <conclusion>In this paper, we developed a relationship network between
skills in recruitment domain by using the neural net inspired
by Word2vec model. We observed that it is possible to
train high quality word vectors using very simple model
architectures due to lower cost of computation. Moreover,
it is possible to compute very accurate high dimensional
word vectors from a much larger dataset. Using Skip-gram
architecture and an advanced technique for preprocessing
data, the result seems to be impressive. The result of our
work can contribute to building the matching system betweencandidates and job post. In the other hand, candidates can
ﬁnd the gap between the job post requirements and their
ability, so they can ﬁnd the suitable trainings.
A direction we can follow in the future: adding domain
in training model, for example: Between Python ,Java, and
R, inData Science domain, Python andRare more relevant
than Java, however in Back End domain, Python andJava
are more relevant than R.</conclusion>

  <abstract>Multi-sentence compression aims to generate a short and informative compression from several source sentences that deal with the same
topic. In this work, we present a new corpus for the Multi-Sentence Compression (MSC) task in Portuguese and Spanish. We also
provide on this corpus a comparison of two state-of-the-art MSC systems.</abstract>
  <introduction>
Among the various applications of Natural Language Pro-
cessing, Automatic Text Summarization (ATS) aims at
summarizing one or more texts automatically. Summariza-
tion systems identify relevant data and create a summary
from key information. The (Multi-)Sentence Compression
task can be seen as a subproblem of ATS with the objective
to generate a shorter, informative and correct sentence from
source sentence(s).
In many cases, state-of-the-art NLP systems are evaluated
with experiments restrained to the English language, in part
because there are a lot of available English resources for
most NLP tasks. As regards Multi-Sentence Compression
(MSC), the available resources are unfortunately limited; to
our knowledge, only one dataset is freely available and it is
conﬁned to the French language (Boudin and Morin, 2013).
In this work, we present a new annotated corpus in the Por-
tuguese and Spanish languages for the MSC task. Using
this corpus, we evaluate two state-of-the-art systems and
show that the use of several languages leads to more miti-
gated results on the superiority of one system than the use
of the French corpus alone.
The remainder of this paper is organized as follows. In Sec-
tion 2, we characterize MSC with respect to related tasks
from the perspective of the available corpora. Section 3
describes the creation and the features of our corpus. In
Section 4 we analyze the results achieved by state-of-the-
art methods using our dataset. Finally, conclusions are set
out in Section 5.
</introduction>
  <corps>Sentence Compression (SC) aims at producing a reduced
grammatically correct sentence from a source sentence. SC
can be used in the context of the abstractive summarization
of documents, the generation of article titles or the simpli-
ﬁcation of complex sentences, using diverse methods (opti-
mization, syntactic structure, deletion of words and/or gen-
eration of sentences). The corpora for SC can be dividedin two categories: deletion-based and summarization-based
SC.
In the case of SC by deletion of words, sentences are
compressed by removing irrelevant words (Filippova et al.,
2015; Ive and Yvon, 2016). Knight and Marcu (2002) de-
veloped a SC corpus by aligning abstracts and sentences
extracted from the Ziff-Davis corpus, which is a collec-
tion of newspaper articles announcing computer products.
Clarke and Lapata (2008) provided two manually created
two-reference corpora for deletion-based compression. Fil-
ippova and Altun (2013), and Filippova et al. (2015) ex-
tracted and released deletion-based compressions by align-
ing news headlines to the ﬁrst sentences. Finally, Ive and
Yvon (2016) developed an English-French parallel corpus
for the compression and simpliﬁcation tasks.
SC by generations of sentences analyzes a whole sentence
and generates a new shorter sentence with the core infor-
mation of the source sentence (Rush et al., 2015; Gan-
itkevitch et al., 2011; Cohn and Lapata, 2008; Toutanova
et al., 2016). Ganitkevitch et al. (2011) created a corpus
of compression paraphrases composed of parallel English-
English sentences obtained from multiple reference transla-
tions. Rush et al. (2015) produced compression pairs made
up of the headline of each article and its ﬁrst sentence; they
released their code to extract data from the annotated Gi-
gaword (Graff et al., 2011). Cohn and Lapata (2008) and
Toutanova et al. (2016) describe two manually created ab-
stractive compression corpora that are publicly available.
The dataset presented in Cohn and Lapata (2008) comprises
a single-reference sentence pairs for abstractive summary,
while the corpus developed by Toutanova et al. (2016) has
multiple references for short paragraph compressions.
Multi-Sentence Compression (MSC), also known as Multi-
Sentence Fusion, is a variation of SC. MSC aims at ana-
lyzing a cluster of similar sentences to generate a new sen-
tence, which is shorter than the average length of source
sentences and has the key information of the cluster (Barzi-
lay and McKeown, 2005; Filippova, 2010). MSC enables
summarization and question-answering systems to gener-

ate outputs combining fully formed sentences from one or

for MSC and are composed of clusters of similar sentences
from different source news in English, French, Spanish or
Vietnamese languages (Barzilay and McKeown, 2005; Fil-
ippova, 2010; Boudin and Morin, 2013; Thadani and McK-
eown, 2013; Luong et al., 2015). Filippova’s corpus as
well as Boudin and Morin’s contain clusters of similar sen-
tences, each cluster composed of at least 7 or 8 sentences,
whereas the datasets introduced in (McKeown et al., 2010)
and (Luong et al., 2015) have only a pair of source sen-
tences per cluster. McKeown et al. (2010) collected 300
English sentence pairs taken from newswire clusters using
Amazon’s Mechanical Turk. Likewise, the dataset built by
Luong et al. (2015) contains 250 Vietnamese sentences di-
vided into 115 groups of similar sentences with 2 sentences
per group. Thadani and McKeown (2013) presented an En-
glish corpus with 1,858 clusters having between 2 and 4
sentences; this dataset was built using automatic methods
from annotations made for the DUC1and TAC2evalua-
tions. The corpora presented in (McKeown et al., 2010),
(Boudin and Morin, 2013) and (Luong et al., 2015) are pub-
licly available, but among these three datasets only the sec-
ond one is more suited to multi-document summarization
or question-answering tasks because the documents to ana-
lyze are usually composed of many similar sentences.
3. Dataset Description
We introduce a novel annotated corpus collected from Por-
tuguese and Spanish Google News.3This corpus is com-
posed of clusters of similar sentences along with reference
compressions for each cluster. The data are described in the
following subsections. Table 1 summarizes the characteris-
tics of the corpus and Table 2 shows a small example of our
Portuguese dataset.
3.1. Source Sentences
In keeping with the methodology introduced by Filippova
(2010), we collected links from Google News in Spanish
and Portuguese between July and September 2016. These
links redirect international news sites in Spanish ( La Jor-
nada, Milenio, El Economista, BBC Mundo, El Colom-
biano, El Pa ´ıs, CNN en espa ˜nol, etc.) and in Portuguese
1http://duc.nist.gov
2http://www.nist.gov/tac
3The Spanish and Portuguese MSC datasets are freely avail-
able, under GPL license on the DOI website: http://dev.
termwatch.es/ ˜fresa/CORPUS/MSF2/ .(G1, Uol Not ´ıcias, Estad ˜ao, O Globo, etc. ). Each cluster is
composed of related sentences describing a speciﬁc event
and was chosen among the ﬁrst sentence from different ar-
ticles about Science, Sports, Economy, Health, Business,
Technology, Accidents/Catastrophes, General Information
and other subjects. During the collection period, sentences
were gathered among news threads that had at least 8 dif-
ferent sources. The source sentences of each cluster were
manually selected so that they best describe the news, while
sentences dealing with less relevant information were dis-
carded. Each source sentence is composed of at least 8 to-
kens and a verb. In order to ensure the variability of source
sentences inside a cluster, we removed all duplicated sen-
tences, by assuming that sentences were too similar when
the cosine similarity4computed from one-hot vectors was
higher that 0.8. We used the TreeTagger system5to tag the
source sentences with Parts-of-Speech.
3.2. Reference Compressions
Like in (Filippova, 2010; Boudin and Morin, 2013), ref-
erence compressions are edited by human annotators, all
native Portuguese or Spanish speakers, who analyzed the
most relevant facts of a cluster and generated a condensed
sentence of this cluster. We suggested that the annotators
should use the same vocabulary and n-grams as the source
sentences and only select the most relevant information
about the topic. We also recommended that they should
generate compressions that are shorter than the length aver-
age of the source sentences. The following sections provide
details about the Portuguese and Spanish parts of the cor-
pus and, as a matter of comparison, brieﬂy recalls the main
characteristics of the French corpus built by Boudin and
Morin.
3.2.1. Portuguese Dataset
The Portuguese corpus is composed of 40 clusters. Each
cluster has at least 10 similar sentences by topic and 2 refer-
ence compressions made by 2 human annotators. This cor-
pus contains 17,998 tokens and has a vocabulary of 2,438
tokens. Source sentences have an average of 33.1 tokens
per sentence with a standard deviation of 9.9 tokens. The
Type-Token Ratio (TTR) indicates the reuse of tokens in
the cluster and is deﬁned by the number of unique tokens
divided by the number of tokens in each cluster; the lower

the TTR, the greater the reuse of tokens in the cluster. The
sentence similarity represents the average cosine similarity
of the sentences in a cluster. Using these metrics, references
have an average length of 17.8 tokens and a standard devi-
ation of 1.5 tokens, while the Portuguese source corpus has
a TTR of 33.7%. The Portuguese annotators generated the
compressions with a TTR of 67.9% and a sentence similar-
ity of 0.59. Finally, the average compression ratio between
the reference and source sentences is 54%.
3.2.2. Spanish Dataset
The Spanish part is also composed of 40 clusters. It has
30,588 tokens and a vocabulary of 4,390 tokens. Each clus-
ter has 20 similar sentences on the same topic and 4 refer-
ence compressions made by 4 human annotators. Source
sentences have an average of 38.2 tokens per sentence with
a standard deviation of 10.7 tokens and an average TTR of
35.2%. Reference compressions contain the same vocab-
ulary as source sentences while keeping an average size of
23.1 tokens, a standard deviation of 2.4 tokens and a TTR of
43.4%. The sentence similarity between the compressions
is 0.64. The average compression rate is 61%.
3.2.3. French Dataset
We used in the following experiments the French corpus
developed by Boudin and Morin (2013). This corpus also
has 40 clusters composed of 618 sentences (33 tokens on
average). The clusters are composed of 15 sentences on
average and the TTR of the corpus is 38.8%. Reference
compressions have a compression rate of 60%.
4. Experimental Evaluation
We used our corpus to provide a more thorough evalua-
tion of state-of-the-art approaches for MSC than the study
on the French corpus alone. We tested on our dataset a
simple baseline, as well as (Filippova, 2010) and (Boudin
and Morin, 2013) methods. Filippova modeled clusters of
similar sentences as Word Graphs based on the cohesion
of tokens and their Part-of-Speech (PoS). Inspired by the
good results of the Filippova’s method, Boudin and Morin
used the TextRank method as a re-rank method to analyze
the sentences generated by Filippova’s method in order to
produce well punctuated and hopefully more informative
compressions. The baseline system creates a Word Graph
(WG) like Filippova’s method, but this time all arcs have
the same weight. Then, the system generates a compres-
sion represented by the shortest path in the WG that hasat least 8 tokens. Algorithms were implemented using the
Python programming language and the takahe6library.
4.1. Automatic and Manual Metrics
The most important features of MSC are informativeness
and grammaticality. Informativeness is the percentage of
the main information retained in the compression, while
grammaticality analyzes whether a sentence is correct or
not.</corps>
  <conclusion>Multi-Sentence Compression aims to generate a short infor-
mative text summary from several sentences with related
and redundant information. This task can be used in the
domain of multi-document summarization or question an-
swering to provide more informative and concise texts.
In this paper, we presented a new annotated corpus in
two languages that extends the French data made available
in (Boudin and Morin, 2013). We also compared two state-
of-the art systems on this new dataset. We hope this cor-
pus will help the NLP community to develop and validate
multi-language methods for multi-sentence compression.
In order to extend the multi-language resources to more di-
verse languages, we plan to create a similar MSC dataset
for Arabic. We also want to use our corpus to test other
competitive MSC systems, such as the one based on integer
linear programming we introduced in (Linhares Pontes et
al., 2016).</conclusion>
  <discussion>N/A</discussion>
  <bibliographie>are assumed to contain the most important
information. Thus we calculated informativeness scores
based on the common information between the output of
the MSC system and the references using ROUGE (Lin,
2004). In particular, we used the f-measure metrics
ROUGE-1, ROUGE-2 and ROUGE-SU4. Like in Boudin
and Morin (Boudin and Morin, 2013), ROUGE metrics are
calculated using stop words removal and stemming.7
We also led a manual evaluation with 4 native speakers
for each language. The native speakers of each language
judged the compression in two aspects: informativeness
and grammaticality. In the same way as (Filippova, 2010;
Boudin and Morin, 2013), the native speakers evaluated the
grammaticality in a 3-point scale: 0 point for an ungram-
matical compression, 1 point for compression with minor
mistakes; and 2 points for a correct compression. The in-
formativeness evaluation process is similar for grammati-
cality: 0 point if the compression is not related to the main
topic, 1 point if the compression misses some relevant in-
formation and 2 points if the compression conveys the gist
of the main event.

8Although we used the same system and data as (Boudin and
Morin, 2013) for the French corpus, we were not able to repro-
duce exactly their results. The ROUGE scores given in their arti-
cle are close to ours for their system: 0.6568 (ROUGE-1), 0.4414
(ROUGE-2) and 0.4344 (ROUGE-SU4), but using Filippova’s
system we measured higher scores than them: 0.5744 (ROUGE-
1), 0.3921 (ROUGE-2) and 0.3700 (ROUGE-SU4).

Table 4 provides statistics on the length and the compres-
sion ratio of the sentences generated by the systems. The
baseline system output the shortest compressions, which
translated into the worst ROUGE scores. For the three
tested datasets, Filippova’s method generated shorter com-
pressions with a smaller standard deviation than Boudin
and Morin’s system. Let us note that for this last system
the lengths of the outputs are less regular across the three
languages.
The Portuguese and Spanish languages derive from Latin
and are closely related languages. However, they differ in
many details of their grammar and lexicon. Moreover, the
datasets produced for the three languages are unlike accord-
ing to several features. First, our corpus contains a smaller
(Portuguese corpus) and a larger (Spanish corpus) dataset
in terms of sentences than the original French corpus. Be-
sides, the compression rates of the three datasets (see Sec-
tion 3.) indicates that the Portuguese source sentences have
more irrelevant tokens. The sentence similarity (Table 1,
last line) describes the variability of sentences in the source
sentences and in the references, and reﬂects here that the
sentences are slightly more diverse for the Portuguese cor-
pus. It can be noticed that the references are more similar
too each other than source sentences since they only retain
the main information. Finally, the French corpus has a TTR
of 38.8% whereas the Portuguese and Spanish datasets have
TTRs of 33.7% and 35.2%, respectively.
The baseline system generated the shortest compression be-
cause all arcs of the WG have the same weights. However,
this system analyzes neither the grammaticality nor the
most used n-grams in the clusters. Consequently, the base-
line system generated compressions with the worst ROUGE
scores.
4.3. Human Evaluation
ROUGE only analyzes the overlapping between the candi-
date compression and the references. Since this analysis is
not reliable enough, we led a further manual evaluation to
study the informativeness and grammaticality of compres-
sions, as described in Section 4.1.. Given the poor results
of the baseline with ROUGE, we only analyzed the Filip-
pova’s and Boudin and Morin’s methods (Table 5).
We measured inter-rater agreement on the judgments we
collected, obtaining values of Fleiss’ kappa of 0.418, of
0.305 and 0.364 for French, Portuguese and Spanish re-
spectively. These results show that human evaluation is
rather subjective. Questioning evaluators on how they pro-
ceed to rate sentences reveals that they often made their
choice by comparing outputs for a given cluster. As the
differences of the grammaticality and the informativeness
scores for the methods are not statistically signiﬁcant, wemove our investigation on the average and standard de-
viation of the results. Both methods generated compres-
sions of good quality (scores higher than 1) for all datasets,
especially for the French and the Portuguese parts where
scores above 1.5 for grammaticality and above 1.2 for in-
formativeness were obtained. Filippova’s method gener-
ated more correct compressions (except for the Portuguese
corpus where both methods obtained almost the same re-
sults), which shows that the re-ranking step tends to mod-
erately deteriorate grammaticality. By contrast, Boudin
and Morin’s method consistently improves informative-
ness, which validates the interest of integrating the anal-
ysis of key phrases inside candidate compressions. This re-
ranking method combines the cohesion score of Filippova
and the relevance of key phrases9to generate more infor-
mative compression. This method selects the path of Word
Graph that has relevant key phrases even if this path has a
lower cohesion quality.
All in all, Boudin and Morin’s method generated more in-
formative but also longer compressions than Filippova’s,
CR showing a relative increase of 18% between both sys-
tems (Table 4).

  <abstract>Much of the existing research on the social and ethical impact of Artiﬁcial Intelligence has been
focused on deﬁning ethical principles and guidelines surrounding Machine Learning (ML) and other
Artiﬁcial Intelligence (AI) algorithms [IEEE, 2017, Jobin et al., 2019]. While this is extremely useful for
helping deﬁne the appropriate social norms of AI, we believe that it is equally important to discuss both
the potential and risks of ML and to inspire the community to use ML for beneﬁcial objectives. In the
present article, which is speciﬁcally aimed at ML practitioners, we thus focus more on the latter, carrying
out an overview of existing high-level ethical frameworks and guidelines, but above all proposing both
conceptual and practical principles and guidelines for ML research and deployment, insisting on concrete
actions that can be taken by practitioners to pursue a more ethical and moral practice of ML aimed at
using AI for social good.</abstract>
  <introduction>N/A</introduction>
  <corps>1 Artiﬁcial Intelligence Leaves the Research Lab
Progress in ML in the last decade has been extraordinary and has rekindled the notion that AI systems could
eventually reach human levels of performance, which was abandoned for several decades. Even if we are
still currently far from this achievement, technological progress in ML has passed a threshold which enables
it to have a huge economic impact, estimated to be close to 16 trillion US dollars by 2030 [Szczepa ´nski,
2019]. This contrasts with the ﬁrst few decades of ML progress, when researchers had the luxury of fo-
cusing purely on the fundamental aspects of their work, not worrying too much about its potential societal
impacts – an object recognition algorithm could be tested on a common dataset like MNIST [LeCun et al.,
1998] or ImageNet [Deng et al., 2009], and an objective performance metric would be obtained in order to
measure progress, without having to think about the messiness and complexity of deployment and social
impact. Something crucial has changed in recent years, as algorithms initially developed in the lab are
increasingly being improved and deployed in society, in real-world applications such as healthcare, trans-
portation and industrial production with real-life consequences, and we are likely seeing just the tip of the
iceberg in terms of social impact. Along the way, this deployment in society has forced the realization that
these algorithms have social impacts which could be positive or negative. For example, we have realized
that biases hidden in data and algorithms could lead to more discrimination, in the simplest case simply
because of the data imbalance: facial recognition algorithms have been found to underperform on gender
and racial minorities [Buolamwini and Gebru, 2018]. Furthermore, above and beyond hidden biases, given
the high impact potential of ML research, the question stands of whether practitioners are acting with the
best interests of humanity and society in mind when developing their tools and applications.
As ML researchers and engineers, we believe that we have a shared responsibility to consider both ethics
and moral values when we choose what we work on, for what organization, and whether the products we
contribute to directly or indirectly will be beneﬁcial to humanity or more likely to end up hurting more
than helping. Unfortunately, very few of us have been trained to think about these questions. Instead,
most of us have focused from a very young age on mathematics and computer science and not so much
on philosophy and other humanities. A good step towards learning about these issues is to consult the
documents proposing ethical guidelines for AI, which we will cover in Section 2. Furthermore, in order
Also CIFAR Senior Fellow
1arXiv:1912.11945v1  [cs.CY]  26 Dec 2019to offer a guiding direction for such debates and soul-searching within the scope of ML, we propose the
following self-directed questions:
1. How is the technology that I am working on going to be used?
2. Who will beneﬁt or suffer from it?
3. How much and what social impact will it have?
4. How does my job ﬁt with my values?
We are conscious that the questions listed above are subjective and the answers will depend highly on the
values and ethics of the individual answering them. Nonetheless, we hope that work on some applications,
such as the design and deployment of lethal autonomous weapons and automatic surveillance, will clearly
be seen to contradict fundamental rights and dignity, as deﬁned in, among other places, the UN Declaration
of Human Rights [1948]. Other applications of ML, such as those increasing the efﬁciency of advertising or
beating the stock market, are less clear-cut in their moral value, and merit informed debate and discussion
within the scientiﬁc community and society at large. As some of us become more conscious of the potential
or deﬁnite social impact of ML, we have the opportunity, if not the duty, to make our voices heard. A good
example of this is a recent letter signed by numerous scientists calling for an international treaty banning
lethal autonomous weapon systems, e.g., killer drones which can decide to shoot at a person without human
involvement, which would make it possible to take the broad social, moral and psychological context into
account and potentially decide to abort the mission (for instance, when the target is in a school or at a family
dinner surrounded by women and children).
Finally, while the legal frameworks to oversee and limit research and development violating these prin-
ciples are often and unfortunately updated in a reactive rather than a proactive manner, we believe that
we should not wait until all of the dots between ML and ethics are formally connected by legislation and
regulation. We believe that we have a responsibility to educate ourselves, to think ahead about potential
consequences, to use our internal moral compasses and to consciously choose the direction of the research
or engineering that we practice. This is important because we believe that we are faced with a wisdom
race: as technology becomes more powerful, its impact can be proportionally greater, either positively or
negatively.
To curb the negative impact, we need to become wiser individually (as reﬂected in our personal deci-
sions) and collectively (through social norms, laws and regulations). Unfortunately, technological progress
in AI has accelerated faster than the current rate of progress of personal and social wisdom, ultimately mak-
ing it possible for unwise humans or organizations, even those with good intentions and acting legally, to
have large-scale, major destructive effects. This is comparable to a world in which nuclear bombs (i.e. very
powerful technology) were accessible and usable by children (i.e., persons with insufﬁcient maturity and
wisdom), which could easily result in global nuclear war. This highlights the importance of the discussions
still to be had by large numbers of ML practitioners about ethics and social impact, as well as the safeguards
that need to be put in place to protect especially the most vulnerable members of our society. We will dis-
cuss some of the most advanced efforts to introduce these safeguards in the next section, followed by some
examples of socially beneﬁcial applications of ML.
2 Ethics and AI - Existing Initiatives
In recent years, there have been numerous initiatives which have taken one of two major approaches to
fostering the ethical practice of AI: (1) Proposing principles guiding the socially responsible development
of AI or (2) Raising concerns about the social impact of AI. We will describe both approaches in the current
section, as well as giving examples of notable initiatives and projects which have adopted either of the
approaches.1
1For a more complete overview of different global ML ethics initiatives, see a recent review in Jobin et al. [2019]
22.1 Deﬁning Principles for Practicing AI Responsibly
The topic of ethical research and practice in technology has been gaining momentum in different corners of
the computing community in recent years, and the various initiatives that have been proposed are indicative
of the interest and the concern that many members share. For instance, in the United States, the Association
for Computing Machinery (ACM) has proposed a Code of Ethics and Professional Conduct, to be followed
by all members of the association and to guide them in their usage of computer science [Gotterbarn et al.,
2018]. A similar initiative was undertaken by the Royal Statistical Society (RSS) in the United Kingdom,
which has created a practical guide for practitioners regarding the ethical use of mathematics [RSS, 2019].
In the present section, we will address the two most relevant and extensive initiatives to establish ethical
guidelines for AI research and practice: the Montreal Declaration for Responsible Development of AI and
the IEEE report for Ethically Aligned Design.
2.1.1 The Montreal Declaration for a Responsible Development of Artiﬁcial Intelligence
One of the most notable approaches to establishing guidelines for AI deployment is the Montreal Declara-
tion for a Responsible Development of Artiﬁcial Intelligence, developed in 2017 and revised in 2018 based
on public feedback2. It was elaborated under the premise that given the assumption that since AI will even-
tually affect all sectors of society, it requires principles to guide its development to ensure its adherence to
human values and social progress. The resulting Declaration has ten principles, ranging from protection
of privacy to equal representation, with some principles touching responsibility and ethics directly; for in-
stance, the principle of Prudence stipulates that “Every person involved in AI development must exercise
caution by anticipating, as far as possible, the adverse consequences of AIS [Artiﬁcial Intelligent Systems]
use and by taking the appropriate measures to avoid them. ” These principles were deﬁned after extensive
debates and dialogue between both specialists and non-specialists from different domains and parts of the
world to ensure representability and cohesion. The overall aim of the declaration was to spark public debate
and to encourage a progressive and inclusive orientation to the development of AI.
However, the Montreal declaration goes further than theoretical ethical principles, proposing recom-
mendations to accomplish an ethical digital transition that includes all of the different levels of society,
from researchers to policy-makers. For instance, it includes a proposition for auditing and validating the
use of AIS using concrete frameworks and certiﬁcations in order to prevent biases and discrimination. Spe-
ciﬁc steps were also proposed for ensuring the protection of democracy and reducing the environmental
footprint of AI, all within the framework of a democratic and citizen-led process. This is important given
that the effects of AI will permeate all levels of society, from the programmers and engineers who write
the code, to the leaders who will legislate it, and the businesses who will make products with it that will be
used by all. The process of creation of the Montreal declaration was consequently the keystone to building
a way of including all of these different stakeholders in the elaboration of an ethical AI, and paves the way
for subsequent work on the topic.
2.1.2 IEEE Ethically Aligned Design
A more recent effort, initiated by the IEEE Global Initiative on Ethics of Autonomous and Intelligent Sys-
tems, carried out an in-depth study on the issue of the ethics surrounding the design of AI systems [IEEE,
2017]. In particular, aspects that are relevant to the topics covered in the present paper include: the usage of
A/IS [autonomous and intelligent systems] in service to sustainable development for all, and more specif-
ically for the attainment of the United Nations Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) [UNHCR, 2017].
The authors of the study speciﬁcally underline the potential of AI to contribute to resolving some of the
world’s most urgent problems, such as climate change and poverty, given the necessary will and orientation
towards these problems. Furthermore, they highlight the fact that despite their great potential, current AI
deployment and development is currently not aligned with these goals and impacts [IEEE, 2017, p. 144],
which is unsettling given the myriad of ML project and initiatives worldwide.
The IEEE report also lays down principles to guide “the ethical and values-based design, development,
and implementation of autonomous and intelligent systems” , many of which are similar to those deﬁned
2https://www :montrealdeclaration-responsibleai :com/
3by the Montreal Declaration: respect of human rights, data agency, transparency, accountability, etc. They
go further in proposing that “A/IS creators shall adopt increased human well-being as a primary success
criterion for development” instead of focusing on isolated metrics such as accuracy, and, from a deployment
perspective, offering alternative metrics to quantify meaningful progress, for instance by evaluating social,
economic and environmental factors instead of proﬁt and other common success metrics. The report also
includes propositions for policymakers, legislators and other stakeholders from the extended AI community
and, as such, represents the most extensive effort of establishing ethical boundaries and guidelines for AI
research to date.
In a recent survey of the various global ethics guidelines proposed around AI, the authors observed that
despite a conceptual overlap between the many existing guidelines, including the two mentioned above,
there are major differences regarding how the principles are interpreted [Jobin et al., 2019]. This underlines
the complexity and nuance of applying theoretical, philosophical principles in practice, and raises questions
such as: what aspects of the AI research and deployment pipeline do ethics principles affect? how would it
be possible to resolve conﬂicts between, for instance, fairness and sustainability (i.e. training an algorithm
longer and with more data - thus potentially leading to more greenhouse gas emissions - to ensure that it
is not discriminatory and covers all demographic groups equally well)? And, above all, how is it possible
to translate ethical principles into a programming language? In any case, the bridge between theory and
practice has yet to be built and there are different ways in which that can happen. This underlines the
necessity of involving actors from different levels of the AI ecosystem (and neighboring ones) in order to
ensure that experts in policy-making work in tandem with experts in coding and engineering to create tools
and frameworks that are coherent and usable by all.
2.2 Identifying Ethical Concerns of AI Applications
There are several types of ethical concerns regarding AI applications and, in this paper, we will focus more
concretely on bias leading to potential discrimination. While it is true that on the one hand, AI-infused
technology such as computer vision can enhance public security, for instance by identifying crime in real-
time based on CCTV cameras, but the trade-off is that can also be abused to track individuals and to establish
a surveillance state where privacy is greatly threatened by those who control the technology. On the military
side, similar technology can be used to design autonomous drones which use computer vision to identity
their target, representing a grave threat to global security and democracy due to the lack of human oversight.
In addition to the security risk, such weapons would be moral and legal hazard: AI technology is not yet
capable to comprehend and represent the social and psychological context in which such a targeted attack
could take place in a manner that is coherent with international laws regarding war as well as with human
morality.
Unfortunately, the most common argument brought in favour of developing lethal autonomous weapons
is that they are needed as a precautionary measure (i.e. since other countries are undeniably working on
them, each country needs to do the same). In reality, the weapons needed to defend against killer drones
would be very different from the drones themselves, and do not need to be lethal autonomous weapons since
they would be designed to destroy weapons rather than to target people, similar to the Iron Dome used by
Israel. Another common argument is that an international treaty would be useless since some countries will
refuse to sign it. But we have seen in the past that even when major powers do not sign a treaty (such as
the one on anti-personnel mines, signed by 133 countries, excluding the US, in 1997), the treaty can still be
used to create a moral stigma, as well as a decline in demand; in the case of anti-personnel mines, the result
has been that U.S. companies have stopped building them, even though their government never signed the
treaty. Another ﬂawed argument is that regulating lethal autonomous weapons could threaten the innovation
in AI, whereas in fact AI has been developed very successfully in a civilian setting (mostly in academia and
major technology companies) and its continued development does not require neither data nor engineering
which would come from AI military development.
Another potential threat to democracy stemming from AI could come not simply from the increased
ability to monitor and to target individuals, but also from the more subtle power to inﬂuence them, e.g. via
AI-driven advertising, automated online trolls and other psychological manipulations via the internet and
social media. The recent use of AI to inﬂuence political campaigns such as the 2016 US election or Brexit
is just the beginning of what can be done when machines learn how to “press our buttons” in a personalized
way. This is due to the fact that micro-targeting makes it possible for ads to be truly bespoke depending
4on your political views, network of friends and personal history. While we may not mind being inﬂuenced
when it comes to choosing a brand of soft drinks, when the proﬁt or power motives of a corporation or
political organization go against our individual and collective interests, it becomes important to establish
social norms, laws and regulations to protect us from such psychological manipulation. But where should
the line be drawn between, for example, manipulation and education? These are difﬁcult questions but
there are clues which can be used (like whether the organization that stands to proﬁt is paying for the
advertisement or social network inﬂuence), so human judgement remains key for judging the ethical aspect,
e.g. in balancing different values (like autonomy vs well-being, when considering an ad campaign against
cigarettes, for example). In the case of advertising, what is interesting is that in addition to the moral hazard
associated with psychological manipulation, it is not even clear that advertising is beneﬁcial to society from
a purely economic perspective, as it tends to favour established brands and thus slow down innovation.
Closely related to the political misuse and manipulation with AI is also increasing concern about AI-
generated false images, videos and news. Thanks to rapid progress in generative neural networks such as
the GANs [Goodfellow et al., 2014], it is becoming possible to synthesize images and sounds in a controlled
way, e.g., using “deep fakes” for making a video of a president declaring war, or with the face of a celebrity
seamlessly integrated on the body and behavior of a pornography actor. Other commonly discussed concerns
of AI deployment include the effect on the job market [Perisic, 2018], which means that governments and
communities must prepare, e.g. by adapting the education system and the social safety net, which can
take decades, as well as the potential concentration of power which it may lead to in speciﬁc individuals,
corporations and countries, and the bias and discrimination it may contribute to increase, as we discuss next.
2.2.1 Identifying and Mitigating Bias
In recent years, we have been confronted numerous times with the fact that biased algorithmic systems can
perpetuate injustice and discrimination, whether we are aware of it or not. There are many different ways
that this kind of bias can creep into algorithms: it can be from the data itself, or the implicit bias that the
creator programmed into the system, and even the way the problem is framed3. Therefore, in order to ensure
that the models that we develop and the systems that they are later used in are as fair and ethical as possible,
there are steps to take to identify bias and to reduce it as much as possible.
Numerical Bias
A major challenge in designing ML systems is understanding how they work during training and deploy-
ment, and what factors and features they use to make decisions. However, diagnosing the presence of bias
in these systems is not a straightforward task, since it is not always obvious during a model’s construction
what the downstream impacts of design choices may be; therefore, upstream efforts are needed to reduce
this risk as much as possible. To this end, there have been several proposals to help practitioners identify
and mitigate bias in ML models, some of which we will describe in the current section.
More concretely, exploring, analyzing and visualizing the data used for training a model is a key part
of the ML process. But it is not straightforward to identify bias simply by looking at the data; often, more
in-depth probing is needed to ﬁgure out what features and implicit information is present and, once a model
is developed, how this will inﬂuence the model’s behavior. For instance, it was recently found that the
COMPAS system, a criminal risk assessment tool developed widely used in the United States, is often
biased with respect to race [Angwin et al., 2016]. Whereas the bias in the COMPAS system was identiﬁed
after its deployment, once the data was made public, this bias is an aspect of the model that should have been
identiﬁed much earlier, during development and certainly before deployment. Similarly, off-the-shelf facial
recognition technology used by police forces has been shown to perform much worse on racial and gender
minorities, with a difference of up to 34.4% in error rate between lighter-skinned males and darker-skinned
females, mostly due to the lack of reliable training data [Buolamwini and Gebru, 2018].
To address these types of issues, several approaches exist: for instance, researchers have recently re-
leased a tool called ‘What-If’, an open-source application that lets practitioners not only visualize their
data, but also test the performance of their ML model in hypothetical situations, for instance modifying
3For a more hands-on presentation of bias and fairness in AI, we suggest Google’s Online course designed speciﬁcally for ML
practitioners
5some characteristics of data points and analyzing subsequent model behavior, by measuring fairness met-
rics such as Equal Opportunity and Demographic Parity [Wexler et al., 2019]. Other approaches address
bias by changing the training procedure or the structure of ML models themselves, for instance by trans-
forming the raw data in a space in which discriminatory information cannot be found [Zemel et al., 2013]
or using a variational autoencoder to learn the latent structure from the dataset and using this structure to
re-weight the importance of speciﬁc data points during model training [Ribeiro et al., 2016]. Whatever the
approach chosen, using these kinds of tools during ML model development and deployment can change the
life of individual people, who could go from unfairly spending decades in prison to having the chance of a
better life – an immensely important difference when multiplied by the thousands of people whose lives can
be affected by the deployment of these tools. This multiplication of bias is especially important to consider
since ML is being used more and more, and therefore even edge cases and small minorities can be ampliﬁed
in real-world applications.
Textual Bias
Bias is not always in numbers, it can also manifest itself in the words that we use to describe the
world around us. For instance, in 2018, Reuters reported that Amazon was forced to decommission an
ML-powered recruiting engine when it was discovered that it penalized any mention of female-related
vocabulary, including applicants who attended all-women colleges [Dastin, 2018]. This is not surprising
given the gender disparity that exists in the technology sector and since the data used to develop this tool
was comprised of resumes submitted (and accepted) to Amazon over a 10-year period. It is nonetheless
disturbing in terms of algorithmic fairness, especially if algorithms such as this one make ﬁltering or hiring
decisions that can ultimately affect an entire gender’s lives and careers. This can potentially create a negative
feedback loop, as such a system would reduce the number of female workers and thus the number of
positive role models for girls interested in technology. A similar type of gender bias was also found in
pretrained word embedding models, which were found to exhibit gender stereotypes in terms of higher
cosine similarity between, for instance, ‘woman’ and ‘homemaker’ or ‘receptionist’ as opposed to ‘woman’
and ‘doctor’ or ‘lawyer’, notably due to these biases existing in the corpus that they were trained on, which
consisted of mainstream news articles [Bolukbasi et al., 2016].
In order to reduce and eventually remove gender bias in written text, researchers have proposed ap-
proaches such as identifying the gender subspace of vectors and adjusting the dimensions in a way that
either neutralizes or entirely removes gender bias [Bolukbasi et al., 2016]. Others have deﬁned a formal
gender bias taxonomy in order to capture gender bias and to train ML models to later identify this bias in
texts [Hitti et al., 2019]. Debiasing the computational representation of language, notably word embedding
models, is especially important because of the extent of their usage; pretrained embedding models trained
on corpora such as Google News and the Common Crawl are used in a variety of applications and systems,
and can therefore continue perpetuating gender bias in downstream usages in Natural Language Processing
(NLP) applications such as dialogue systems. This is a challenge given the complex and sub-symbolic na-
ture of modern NLP, which makes it difﬁcult to analyze speciﬁc features and aspects of data and identify
latent connections and bias between words and concepts. Therefore, more work is needed to explore and
analyse these issues, which constitutes an interesting research direction in itself, and one that is important
to pursue and to integrate into mainstream ML research.
Despite the research initiatives described above to carve appropriate social norms about AI, there re-
mains a noticeable gap between the recommendations they make and ways to ensure that these are respected.
Legislation of AI is still catching up to the progress made in research and practice, and there have not yet
been any country-level laws governing AI research speciﬁcally. However, there have been, on the one hand,
more high-level legislative frameworks such as the European Union (EU) General Data Protection Regula-
tion (GDPR), which aims to ensure data privacy and protection and, on the other hand, more local initiatives
such as San Francisco’s Facial Recognition Software Ban. Nonetheless, more complete legal frameworks
are needed to control nefarious use of AI and to ensure that the principles deﬁned in theory are applied and
enforced in practice.
63 AI for Good Initiatives
Whereas the proﬁt motive is the main driver behind much of the commercial deployment of AI today, there
are nonetheless many projects going on in academia, government organizations, civil society and industry
labs motivated by more noble objectives, often called AI for Social Good (AISG) projects. In addition
to the speciﬁc projects being undertaken in areas such as healthcare, education or the environment, it is
interesting to highlight higher-level efforts which aim to foster and facilitate these projects. For example,
the AI Commons projec aims to construct a hub where different kinds of actors can connect and collaborate
on AISG projects, e.g., ML graduate students or engineers, problem owners in NGOs or local governments,
philanthropy organizations, or startups which could deploy the ML solutions. Their interaction is to be
facilitated by online tools and datasets as well as a standardized description of the status, progress and
expected impact of each project. We hope that initiatives like this will help solidify and amplify the impact
of AISG; in the meantime, there are also many profoundly positive uses of AI that are emerging and we
would like to highlight and applaud such efforts in the present section.
3.1 AI in Healthcare
Achieving universal health coverage is one of the 17 UN Sustainable Development Goals [UNHCR, 2017]
and although major progress has been made in numerous domains, such as maternal health as well as
HIV/AIDS reduction, there are still many problems that are far from being solved. While ML is not a cure-
all, there are many challenges that it can help with such as personalized medicine, diagnosis of medical
imagery, and improved drug discovery [Ghassemi et al., 2018]. ML in the health sector is in fact a thriving
domain of research, with its own workshops at major ML conferences and research published in major
medical journals read by practitioners worldwide. In the last ﬁve years alone, groundbreaking work has
been done in improving the diagnosis of diabetic retinopathy from a single visit [Arcadu et al., 2019],
detecting breast cancer in lymph nodes [Golden, 2017] and large-scale discovery of diseases based on health
records [Pivovarov et al., 2015]. There is also an increasing number of startups and companies working in
the space, either by commercializing research done in academia or by developing products speciﬁcally
catered to the medical sector, with the most advanced applications harnessing the power of deep learning
for analyzing and classifying medical imagery.
Despite the many exciting advances that are being made, there are many hurdles in ML research in
healthcare, starting from data privacy and control (who owns the data? Can patients share their own data, or
should the process be centralized? How to ﬁnd the right balance between privacy and the lives which will
be saved by applying ML on the aggregated health records from many different sources?), to the manner
in which medical data should be processed (Should it contain information such as race and postal/zip code,
which can impact diagnoses, be included in electronic heath records, or does that open the door to discrim-
ination and bias?) and how should such systems be deployed (human-in-the-loop or fully automated?)4.
There are also often questions of responsibility and interpretability that arise, given the high stakes of de-
ploying ML systems in situations of life and death. In order to make meaningful progress in this sector, it is
therefore important to continue existing research on fair and ethical usage of ML in healthcare [Wiens et al.,
2019] and to ensure that Hippocratic principles are a solid part of the research and development process,
as well as working with stakeholders of the domain (e.g. radiologists, clinicians, patient organizations and
hospital administrators) to propose solutions to the hurdles proposed above.
3.2 AI for Education
The promise of using adaptive intelligent systems and agents for education has been around since the
1960s [Suppes and Morningstar, 1969], but access to personalized digital education tools has yet to be-
come a reality in most countries, especially in the developing world, where it could have the most impact
to democratize education and knowledge [Nye, 2015]. In recent years, given the increasing global shortage
of qualiﬁed teachers along with the increasing number of students, the issue of access to education has
become a global one, a fact highlighted by its presence among the UN SDGs. And yet, the usage of ML
in the education sector has been limited to speciﬁc, narrow applications such as predicting the probability
4For a more extensive overview of the opportunities and challenges of using ML in healthcare, see Ghassemi et al. [2018]
7of learner attrition [Chaplot et al., 2015] or improving learner evaluation [Abbott, 2006]. There are many
reasons for this, starting from the difﬁculty in representing learning content in a domain-agnostic way to
facilitate scalability, to overcoming cultural and linguistic barriers to deploying tutors worldwide, but also
more fundamental issues such as the lack of large-scale educational datasets and the inherent technological
constraints in developing countries.
Despite these hurdles, there are many new and longstanding efforts to create intelligent tutors, be it using
symbolic AI approaches such as ontologies and knowledge modeling [Nkambou et al., 2010], educational
data mining [Dutt et al., 2017] or, more recently, ML-driven approaches [Conati et al., 2018]. However,
there are very high stakes in the ﬁeld, since technological interventions have the potential to make consider-
able, long-term impact on human livelihoods, for example lifting people out of poverty by endowing them
with linguistic and numerical literacy, but these can be hindered by bias and technological constraints. We
therefore agree with recent proposals to improve and support human learning at scale and believe that ML
has a key role to play in this endeavour. This can be done, for instance, by partnering up with existing
education initiatives and organizations in order to learn what their speciﬁc needs are and how ML can be
used to meet them, or else by collaborating with Massive Open Online Course (MOOC) creators in order
to gather data and make it available to the ML community, and ﬁnally by sharing learning materials and
activities used in local education initiatives (e.g. university courses in Machine Learning) so that they proﬁt
learners in places where access to high-quality technical education is limited.
3.3 AI for the Environment
Climate change is, without a doubt, one of the biggest challenges that humanity has faced, and we are at
an important point in history when we are both aware of the issue and still have the possibility to change
its course. Climate change has been described as a ‘wicked’ problem, due to features such as the difﬁculty
in deﬁning the problem itself and in developing and deploying solutions to it, the lack of central authority
that can solve it, the incentives for individual countries or companies to not do their share, and the cognitive
biases that discount the future impacts of our actions [Head et al., 2008, Levin et al., 2012]. Furthermore,
while we do not know of any single technological silver bullet as solution to climate change, there are
nonetheless numerous technical challenges for which ML can be helpful, and which can be combined to
make a signiﬁcant impact on the overall issue. These challenges and the ongoing ML approaches to tackle
them were presented in a recent survey paper [Rolnick et al., 2019]. We will not go into all of these at
length, but we will focus on a few examples that are particularly salient and that we hope will give an idea
of both the relevance of deploying ML in environmental applications and the opportunities that this can
generate.
Energy and Transportation
Together, electricity and transportation systems are estimated to produce close to half of anthropogenic
greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions [Allen et al., 2019] and both sectors have their own unique challenges for
decarbonization. For instance, one of the major obstacles to building and using renewable energy sources
such as solar and wind is the variability of their output, which is inherently problematic since the power
generated by an energy grid must equal the power used by its consumers at any given moment. Currently,
this means that despite the existence of solar panels and wind turbines, these must be complemented by
controllable but highly polluting energy sources such as coal and natural gas plants. ML methods that are
appropriate for time-series predictions, such as Recurrent Neural Networks are particularly suited for these
types of tasks [V oyant et al., 2017] and can dramatically lower the barrier to entry for renewable energy
globally. Furthermore, even in cases where controllable energy sources are used, demand on the energy
grid will still ﬂuctuate based on usage; in this case, ML techniques such as Reinforcement Learning and
Dynamic Scheduling can be used to balance the grid in real time [Vázquez-Canteli and Nagy, 2019].
In transportation, reducing activity is a key part in reducing GHG emissions; however, given the highly
regional nature of transportation methods (i.e. high-speed trains are only an option in Europe, whereas
many major US cities have limited public transportation), custom solutions are needed to make a signiﬁcant
impact. ML can be of particular help in estimating and predicting vehicle ﬂow to minimize it, for example
by helping to optimize the design of new roads and hubs [Sommer et al., 2017] and monitoring trafﬁc [Kaack
8et al., 2019], as well as estimating carbon emissions in real-time [Nocera et al., 2018]. ML can also be used
for designing more energy-efﬁcient batteries [Hoffmann et al., 2019] which will become an increasingly
important concern as more people switch to electric vehicles. In both cases of energy and transportation,
ML can be used to make systems more efﬁcient and to improve predictions of complex phenomena based
on large amounts of data; nonetheless, it remains only one part of the solution, and as tempting as it is to halt
research projects once a theoretically plausible solution has been found (and a research paper published),
what is key here is working with domain experts to bring projects towards deployment, where concrete
impact can be made. Transversal connections between disciplines are therefore key, and must be established
and fostered for projects to ﬂourish.
Individuals and Societies
While changes in our climate can be abstract, quantiﬁed in degrees of warming or tons of CO2, climate
change will also have very concrete impacts on society, for instance by decreasing crop yield, increasing
the frequency of extreme weather events such as hurricanes and storms, and impacting biodiversity. There
are a myriad of ways in which ML can help face these, whether it be by analyzing real-time images and
recordings of ecosystems to detect species [Duhart et al., 2018] and deforestation [McDowell et al., 2015],
improving disaster preparation and response by generating real-time maps from satellite imagery [V oigt
et al., 2007] and even setting an optimal price on carbon to accelerate the transition to a low-carbon energy
economy [Wei et al., 2018]. Finally, while we are far from being able to predict the exact impact that
increasing the carbon tax will have on the different levels of society and industry (i.e. federal and regional
governments, local and international companies, and individuals), this is a worthwhile area of research and
exploration, with potentially huge consequences in helping political leaders make more informed choices
in addressing the climate crisis. It is therefore useful to continue gathering data and building trust between
members of the political ecosystem and ML practitioners to learn from each other and to facilitate the
deployment of technological solutions in setting government policies.
On an individual level, there are many reasons why individuals cannot, or will not, act on climate change,
either common misconceptions regarding the fact that individuals cannot make meaningful impact on a
global problem, or cognitive biases that increase an individual’s psychological distance to climate change.
In the ﬁrst case, ML-infused tools to estimate the carbon footprint of individuals and households [Jones and
Kammen, 2011] and to model individual behavior with regards to sustainable lifestyle choices and technolo-
gies [Carr-Cornish et al., 2011] can be very useful if they are sufﬁciently accurate and deployed on a large
scale. Finally, minimizing psychological distance to the future effects of climate change is a promising way
to reduce cognitive bias – in this regard, it is possible to use images generated using Generative Adversarial
Networks (GANs) which represent the impacts of extreme events on locations that have personal value to
the viewer [Schmidt et al., 2019]. A crucial part of developing ML tools for individuals is, once again,
working with multidisciplinary experts in psychology, scientiﬁc communication, and user design to ensure
that the tools created reach the largest possible audience and maximize their positive impact.</corps>
  <conclusion>Technology in general, and ML more speciﬁcally, carries a great potential for change and disruption. While
neither of these is guaranteed to make the world a better place, this potential can most deﬁnitely be used
to have a positive impact on the world. In the present article, we have illustrated some inspiring projects
that aim to make the world a better place and by using the powerful techniques and approaches that ML has
brought forward. We believe that as ML researchers and practitioners, we have the responsibility to leverage
our (super)powers to contribute to these efforts. This can be done by connecting with established actors from
industry and policy or experts from other relevant disciplines, by learning from their past experiences, and
by working together to propose innovative solutions to major problems, deployed in places where they will
have a positive impact.
We live in a world with many global and local challenges and issues that are in constant evolution, and
it is easy to be overwhelmed by this ﬂux of information and focus on a small sandbox in which we feel
safe and in control, in order to develop and study the aspects of ML that interest us most. But it is naive
9to believe that our sandbox is an isolated isle that is not connected to the rest of the world – since even in
the case of theoretical work, communication and cross-pollination are unavoidable – and each of us is also
a citizen who is concerned collective debates, while many of us could worry about the world in which our
descendants will live. We believe that there are thought processes that should take place in the head of every
ML practitioner regarding the nature of the work they are doing and the potential pitfalls and impacts of
this work in the world around them, some of which we have listed in the ﬁrst part of the current paper. And
while we do not claim to have all the answers to all of these tough questions, we hope that we can start a
conversation that will accompany ML research and practice throughout its infancy towards its tumultuous
teenage years in the coming decades, and eventually towards mature adulthood beyond that.</conclusion>

SYSTEMS</titre>
  <auteurs />
  <abstract>In this paper we account for the main  characteristics and performance of a
number of recently developed term extraction systems. The analysed tools
represent the main strategies followed by  researchers in this area. All systems
are analysed and compared against a set of technically relevant characteristics.

  <introduction>
In the late 80s there was an acute need , from different disciplines and goals, to
automatically extract terminological units from specialised texts. In the 90s large
computerised textual corpora have been constructed resulting in the first programs for terminology extraction
1 (henceforth TE) which have showed
encouraging results.
Throughout the current decade computa tional linguists, applied linguists,
translators, interpreters, scientific journalists and computer engineers have been
interested in automatically isolating terminology from texts. There are many
goals that have led these different profe ssional groups to design software tools so
as to directly extract terminology from texts: building of glossaries, vocabularies
and terminological dictionaries; text indexing; automatic translation; building of

Terminology , 53-88.
1 In order to give a broa der view of TE we use both extractor  and detector  to refer to the same notion.
However, we are aware of the fact that some schol ars attribute different meanings to these words. 2 Aut omatic Term Detection: a Review of C urrent  Systems
knowledge databases; construction of hype rtext systems; construction of expert
systems and corpus analysis.
From the appearance of TERMINO (the first broadly known term detector) in
1990 until today a number of projects to design different types of automatic
terminology detectors have been carried out to assist terminological work.
However, despite the large number of studies in progress, the automatisation of
the terminological extraction phase is still fraught with problems. The main
problems encountered by term extractors are: (1) identification of complex terms, that is, determining where a terminological phrase begins and ends; (2) recognition of complex terms, that is, deciding whether a discursive unit
constitutes a terminological phrase or a free unit; (3) identification of the
terminological nature of a lexical unit, that is, knowing whether in a specialised
text a lexical unit has a terminological na ture or belongs to general language and
(4) appropriateness of a terminological unit to a given vocabulary (this has
scarcely been addressed from the point of view of automatization).
Systems for TE are based on three types of knowledge: (a) linguistic; (b) statistical; (c) hybrid (statistical and linguistic). Hence, there are different
approaches to automatic term detecti on. All systems analyse a corpus of
specialised texts in electronic form and extract lists of word chunks (i.e.
candidate terms) that are to be confirmed by the terminologist. To make the terminologist’s task easier the candidate term is provided with its context and,
when available, with any other furt her information (freque ncy, relationship
between terms, etc.)
Two relevant aspects regarding the nature of terms are termhood and
unithood2; TE systems may be designed based on only one of these two aspects.
Some practical experiments following each scheme for ranking a set terms
extracted from Japanese texts are presented in (Nakagawa &amp; Mori, 1998). They show that results in precision and recall are very close but the set of terms
extracted are a somewhat different. This is still a research issue.
Alongside term detection we find the task of automatic document indexing (i.e.
information retrieval, IR). This applied field of natural language processing
(NLP) techniques has an interesting common point with automatic term
detection, that is, word chunks that index a given document are often
terminological units. This same goal explains why many extraction systems are
rooted on IR as well as on the analys is of a specific IR system with no
application whatsoever to TE.

2 (Kageura &amp; Umino, 1996) refer to unithood  as the degree of stability of  syntagmatic combinations
(collocations) and termhood  as the degree in that a linguistic unit is related to a domain-specific
concept. AUT OMA TIC TERM DETECTION: A REVIEW  OF CURRENT  SYSTEMS  3

The difference between these two approaches lies in the fact that a tool for TE
should extract all terminological units from a te xt, whereas IR focuses on the
extraction of only words or word sequences that better describe the contents of
the document regardless of their grammatical features.
The standard approach to IR consists in processing documents so as to extract the so-called indexing terms . These terms are usually isolated words containing
enough semantic load to provide information about its goodness when describing
documents. Queries are processed in  a similar fashion to extract query terms .
With regard to queries the relevance of documents is based exclusively on their
representing terms. This is the reason why their choice is crucial.
Often these indexing terms are single words although it is known that isolated
words are seldom relevant enough to decide the semantic value of a document
with regard to the query. This fact has given rise to the ever-growing appearance,
in the TREC3 assessments, of word and word-sequence indexing systems using
NLP techniques.
Statistically based systems function by de tecting two or more lexical units whose
occurrence is higher than a given level. This is not a random situation, but it is
related to a particular usage of these lexical units. This principle, called Mutual
Information , also applies to other science domains such as telecommunications
and physics. Term detectors based on hybrid knowledge tend to use this idea
prior to a linguistic-based processing.
The problem with this kind of approach  is that there are low-frequency terms
difficult to be managed by extraction systems. Here it is important to note that
these systems use basically numerical information and thus are prone to be
language-independent. The two most frequen tly used measures in the assessment
of these systems are found in IR: recall  and precision . Recall is defined as the
relationship between the sum of retrieved terms and the sum of existing terms in
the document that is being explored. In contrast precision accounts for the
relationship between those extracted terms that are really terms and the aggregate
of candidate terms that are found. These measures can be interpreted as the
capacity of the detection system to  extract all terms from a document ( recall ) and
the capacity to discriminate between those units detected by the system which
are terms and those which are not ( precision ). The fact that recall accounts for all
terms from a document implies that it is a figure much more difficult to estimate
and improve than precision.
In contrast with this traditional approach, other approaches attempt to solve the problem by using linguistic knowledge, which may include two types of
information:

complex terminological units such as  noun-adjective and noun-preposition-noun.
This calls for the use of regular expressions  and techniques of finite state
automata.
b) Language generic: it consists in the use of more complex systems of NLP that
start with the detection of more basic linguistic structures: noun phrase (NP),
prepositional phrase (PP), etc.
In both approaches each word is associated to a morphological category. In order
to do so different strategies are proposed: from coarse systems that do not make
use of any dictionary to complex syst ems that have an extremely detailed
morphological analysis and a final phase of disambiguation.
Systems that harness structural information resort to techniques of partial
analysis to detect potentially terminologi cal phrasal structures. There are also
systems that benefit from their understanding of what is a non-term so they are at
some point in between those systems already mentioned. Other systems try to
reutilize current terminological databases to find terms, variants or new terms.
Systems based on linguistic knowledge tend to use noise  and silence as a
measure of its efficiency. Noise attempts to assess the rate between discarded
candidates and accepted ones; silence attemp ts to assess those terms contained in
an analysed text that are not detected  by the system. Noise is common problem
of those systems using this approach. Errors in the assignation of morphological category are also shared by these systems.
The type of knowledge used leads to language-specific systems and therefore it
requires a prior linguistic analysis and probably a redesign of many parts of the
system. Knowledge in artificial intelligence has been traditionally obtained from
experts in each domain. This has yielde d several difficulties so that some
scholars have focused on automatization and systematisation in knowledge
acquisition. This strategy seems to show the benefits of a terminological
approach. Thus some researchers (e.g . Condamines, 1995) have proposed the
construction of terminological knowledge da tabases so as to include linguistic
knowledge in traditional databases. Although this is a recent a pproach, there is
no database yet containing all the features that could be used in TE, i.e. there is
hardly any semantic information. Thus closed lists of words containing sparse
semantic information within a given specialised domain have been proposed.
In this paper we attempt to analyse the main systems of terminology extraction in
order to describe its current status and thus  be able to enrich them. This paper is
divided up into two main parts: firstly, the largest part is devoted to describe
various systems of terminology extraction together with a short evaluation in
which weak and strong points have been  outlined. Secondly, the terminology
extraction systems have been classifi ed according to some parameters.  AUT OMA TIC TERM DETECTION: A REVIEW  OF CURRENT  SYSTEMS  5

2. Description of some terminology extraction systems
In the following sections we offer a critical description of number of
semiautomatic terminology extraction systems. In all cases, the following
information is given:
a) The reference data of the system, that  is, the author and the publication where
the tool is first mentioned and the system goal.
b) A brief description of the system.
c) A short evaluation of the most relevant aspects. This evaluation is mainly based on papers, oral presentations in  congresses and working papers, etc.
2.1. ANA
Reference publication:  Enguehard and Pantera (1994)
Main goal: Term extraction
ANA (Automatic Natural Acquisition) ha s been developed in accordance with
the following design principles: non-utilis ation of linguistic knowledge, dealing
with written and oral texts (interview  transcripts) and non-concern about
syntactic errors.
According to the current trend of harnessing statistical techniques in the study of
natural language, scholars use Mutual Information as a measure of lexical
association4. In order to avoid the involvement of linguistic knowledge the
concept of “flexible string recognition” is created, which generates a
mathematical function so as to determine the degree of similarity between words.
Thus, no tool for morphological analysis is needed. For instance, the string
colour of painting  represents other similar strings like: colour of paintings ,
colour of this painting , colour of any painting , etc. The system has neither a
dictionary nor a grammar.
The architecture of ANA is composed of 2 modules: a familiarity module and a discovery module. The first module determines the following 3 groups of words,
which constitute the only required knowledge for term detection:
a. function words (i.e. empty words): a, any , for, in, is, of, to...
b. scheme words (i.e. words establishing semantic relationships) such as box of
nails , where the preposition shows some kind of relationship between box and
nails .
c. bootstrap (i.e. set of terms that cons titutes the kernel of the system and the
starting point for term detection).
The second module consists in a gradua l acquisition process of new terms from
existing ones. Further, links between detected terms are automatically generated

4 Remarkable examples of the use of these tec hniques are the works of Church &amp; Hanks (1989) on
word association and Smadja (1991) on co llocation extraction from large corpora. 6 Aut omatic Term Detection: a Review of C urrent  Systems
to build a sem antic network. This module is based on word co-occurrence that
can have 3 t ypes of i nterpret ations:
• expression : high-frequency  existing term s (T EXP) in the sam e window . The new
word i s consi dered a new t erm and t hus i s included in the semantic network. For
instance if the system  has diesel and engine as a known t erms and fi nds
sequences like: ... the diesel engine is... or ... this diesel engine has... Then the
sequence diesel engi ne is accepted as a new term  and is included in the semantic
network as a new node wi th links t o diesel and engine (see figure below).
• candi date: an existing term  appears frequently (TCAND) together wi th anot her
word and a schem e word as in: ... any shade  of wood... or ... this shade  of
colour ... Here shade  becom es a new term  and is placed in a new node of the
semantic network (see fi gure bel ow).
• expansi on: an existing term  appears freq uently (T EXPA) in the sam e word
sequence, without including an y schem e word: ... use any  soft woods  to... or ...
this soft woods  or... As a result, soft wo od is in corporated into the term  list an d
the sem antic network as a new node wi th a link to woods  (see fi g. 1 bel ow).
The system  keeps on recursively
seeking elem ents with the three
interpretatio ns alread y m entioned
until a new term  is found.
Enguehard and Pant era (1994)
tested it by processi ng a docum ent
in Engl ish of around 25,000 words
and 29 reference term s. The sy stem
managed t o extract 200 t erms with
an error rate of 25%.  shade

Minimising linguistic resources i s an ext remely interesting issue, si nce i t is

A negative asp ect o f the system  is th at those term inological u nits ad ded to the list

2.2. CLARIT5
Refer ence publication:  Evans and Zhai  (1996)
Main goal : Docum ent indexi ng

5 Further infor mation can be found at: http://www .clarit.com . AUT OMA TIC TERM DETECTION: A REVIEW  OF CURRENT  SYSTEMS  7

Docum ent indexi ng for IR  is an i mportant field of appl ication of NLP
techni ques. This branch holds common points with term detection si nce t he word
sequences t hat help in docum ent indexi ng are norm ally terminological units too.
CLARIT belongs t o the group of sy stems that advocat e an elaborat ed textual
processing to detect com plex terms in order to reach a m ore appropriate
descri ption of docum ents. This is the reason why  we have i ncluded t his system
amongst  terminology detectors.
Evans and Zhai  (1996) propose t he fol lowing ki nd of phrases for indexat ion
purposes:
1. lexical atoms (hot dog, stainless steel , data base , on line, ...)
2. head m odifier pai rs (treated strip , ...)
3. subcom pounds ( stainless steel strip , ...)
4. cross-preposi tion m odification pai rs (quality su rface vs. quality o f surface)
The methodol ogy starts with the morphol ogical anal ysis of words and t he
detection of noun phrases (NPs). The sy stem distinguishes si mplex noun phrases
from  cross-preposi tion si mplex phrases.
What is behi nd this is the introduct ion of statistics to corpus linguistics. Statistics
here focuses on docum ents, that is, there is no pri or training corpus. Linguistic
knowledge facilitates the calculation weedi ng out irrelevant st ructures, im proves
the reliab ility o f statistical d ecisio ns and adjusts th e statistical p arameters.
The whol e process i s showed i n the figure bel ow:
First, th e raw tex t is parsed so as to
extract NPs. Then each NP  is
recursively parsed  with the purpose
of finding t he m ost secure
groupi ngs. In t his phase l exical
atom s are also detected and NPs
are structured. Finally at the
generat ion phase t he rem aining
compounds are obt ained.
Lexical atom s are defined as
sequences of t wo or m ore words
constituting a sin gle semantic unit
such as space sh uttle, part of
speech  and hot dog . Since the
detection of t hese uni ts is fraught
with probl ems two heuri stical rules are proposed:  Figure 2 Whole process in CLARIT NPs

b. When act ing as NP , lexical atoms hardl y allow the insertion of words. 8 Aut omatic Term Detection: a Review of C urrent  Systems
The first condition takes place if the frequency of the target pair W1W2 is higher
than any other pair from the NP that is  being processed. In the second condition
the frequencies of grouped and separated o ccurrences are compared and there is
a threshold beyond which the association is weeded out. This threshold is
variable according to the function of  sentence morphological category. In
English texts, the most favoured sequence is that of noun-noun.
NP analysis is also a recursive proce ss. At every new phase the most recent
lexical atoms are used for finding new associations that will be used in the
following phase. The process keeps going until the whole NP is analysed. Let us
consider the example below:
general purpose high performance computer
general purpose [high performance]  computer
[general purpose]  [high performance] computer
[general purpose] [[high performance] computer]
[[general purpose] [[high performance] computer]]
The grouping order shows those sequences with a more reliable association
score. In order to determine the association score a number of rules are taken into
account:
• Lexical atoms are given score 0 as well as adverb combination with
adjective, past participles and progressive verbs,
• Syntactically impossible pairs are given score 100 (noun-adjective, noun-
adverb, adjective-ad jective, etc.).
• As to the remaining pairs, there is a formula that account for the frequency
of each word, the association score of this word with other words from the
NP and of two random parameters.
To increase its reliability the association score is recomputed after every
assignation association. The sy stem has been tested in an actual retrieval task of
document indexing substituting the defau lt NLP module in the CLARIT system.
The corpus and the queries were the st andards used in the TREC conferences.
There have been noticed some improveme nts in recall as well as in precision,
which, in the author’s opinion, justifies the use of these techniques. Then in the
TREC-5 report a more detailed evaluation of the system is made (Zhai et al.
1996). All in all it is concluded that the use of these techniques is effective, which enforces the similarities between term indexing and terminology extraction.

Evaluation
This seems to be an interesting system and the applicability of some basic ideas to terminology detection appears to be feasible. Actually CLARIT holds
similarities with the Daille’s (1994) propos al (a linguistically-driven statistics). AUT OMA TIC TERM DETECTION: A REVIEW  OF CURRENT  SYSTEMS  9

It should be borne in mind, however, that problems of terminology extraction
and document indexing are similar but no identical so that many decisions
should be re-considered strictly from the point of view of term detection. It is
also noteworthy that this system only extracts NP terminological units and the
data provided about how this system works are related to the application for
which it has been designed.
2.3. Daille-94 (ACABIT)
Reference publication:  Daille (1994)
Main goal: Term extraction
The main idea behind this system is to combine linguistic knowledge with
statistical measures. Here the corpus should contain all the morphological
information. Then a list of candidate terms is created according to text sequences
that provide syntactic patterns of term formation. This information uses
statistical methods to filter out this list. This final process is different from other
systems in that it only uses linguistic resources.
Assuming the fact that all terminologi cal banks are basically composed of
compound nouns, the program focuses on the detection of binary compound
nouns  and disregards other co-occurring categories. This assumption lies in the
fact that there is a large number of this kind of nouns in specialised languages. Further, most of these compounds of 3 or  more constituents can be treated in a
binary form.
Those patterns considered relevant for French are N 1 PREP (DET) N 2 and N
ADJ PREP à (DET) N 2, together with right and left coordination. Statistical
algorithms are applied to these patterns. The author is aware of  the fact that the
application of statistical measures leads to some noise rate, that is, low-frequency
terms will not be recognised.
The technique used for pattern recognition is that of finite state automata.
Automata are represented by a subset of grammatical tags to which some lemmas, inflected forms and a punctuation mark are added. Thus we can regard
automata as linguistic filters that select  defined patterns and also determine their
occurrence frequency, distance and variation. Each morphosyntactic pattern is associated with a speci fic finite automaton.
The corpus is given a statistical treatment based on a large number of statistical
measures, which are grouped in the following classes: frequency measures,
association criteria, diversity criteria a nd distance measures. The starting point is
considering the two lemmas that constitu te a pair within a pattern as two
variables on which the dependence degree is measured. Data are represented in a
standard contingency table: 10 Aut omatic Term Detection: a Review of C urrent  Systems

 L2 Ln where a = L 1L2 occurrences
L1 A b  b = L 1+Ln (n≠2) occurrences
Lm C d  c = L m+L2 (m≠1) occurrences
    d = L m+Ln (m≠1 and n≠ 2)
Eighteen measures are applied with th e aim of establishing the degree of
independence of the variables in the contingency table. The analysis of the
results shows that only four of these measures are relevant to the purpose:
frequency, cubed association criterion6 (IM3), likelihood criterion,
Fager/MacGowan criterion.
Evaluation
Unlike in other systems, in ACABIT frequency has turned out to be one of the
most important measures for term detection from a given area. However, the
classification resulting from the application of this frequency shows an important
number of frequent sequences that are not terms and, in contrast, does not
suggest the low-frequency terms.
Daille (1994) believes that the best measur e is the likelihood criterion, since it is
a real statistical test, it proposes a cl assification that acc ounts for frequency, it
behaves adequately with large and medium size corpora and it is not defined in
those cases that are not to be considered . In any case, this measure yields some
noise due to several reasons:
a. Errors in the morphological mark-up.
b. Some combinations that are never of a compounding nature: ko bits (kilobits),
à titre d’exemple  (as an example)... ...
c. Combinations of 3 or more elements, related to the problems of composition
and modification: bande latérale  -unique-  (-single- side band), service fixe  -par
satellite-  (-satellite- fixed service) , etc.
2.4. FA S T R7
Reference publication : Jacquemin (1996)
Main goal : Term variation detection
The aim of this tool is to detect terms variants from a set of previously known
terms. These terms may be available from a reference database or a term
acquisition software. What is crucial in this system that it is not needed to start
from scratch every time. Optionally Fastr can also be used for TE.
The first step for applying Fastr is to obtain and analyse a set of existing terms and thus having a set of rules of a given grammar. The FASTR grammatical

6 The formula was experimentally obtained by the autor from the association number described in
Brown et al. (1988) in the aim of fa vouring the most frequent pairs: IM3=log 2 (a3/(a+b)(a-b))

11

formalism is an extension of that of PATR-II (Shieber, 1986). A partial parser
based on the unification mechanism is responsible for the application of these
rules. Term variants are obtained through a metarule mechanism that is
dynamically calculated.
For instance, the term serum albumin  corresponds to the Noun-Noun sequence
and is associated with the following rule:
rule 1: N 1 → N2 N3
&lt;N 1 lexicalization&gt;= ‘N 2’
&lt;N 2 lemma&gt;=serum
&lt;N 3 lemma&gt;=albumin.
The value indicated by the feature “lexicalization” will be use just before partial parsing to selectively activate the target rules. Thus the above rule is linked to the
word serum  and so is activated when this wo rd occurs in the sentence that is
being parsed.
At a different level several metarules generate new rules in order to describe all
possible variations of each term from the re ference list. Each metarule presents a
particular structure and a specific pa ttern type. For instance, the following
metarule can be applied to the previous rule:
Metarule Coor(X 1 Æ X2 X3) = X1 Æ X2 C4 X5 X3
which leads to the new rule: N 1 Æ N2 C4 X5 N3
This latter rule allows new constructions that substitute C 4 for a conjunction and
X5 for an isolated word such as serum  and egg albumin . The candidate term is
not the whole new construction but the coordinated term (i.e., egg albumin ). The
words that have given way to the new rule (egg  and albumin) maintain their
function of constricted equations of the original rule. Further, they are the
anchoring point for the application of the metarule. A metarule can be associated
with specific restricti ons, as for instance: ( &lt;C 4 lemma&gt; ≠but) or ( &lt;X 5 cat&gt; ≠ Dd).
In this way, those sequences with no lexical relationship such as serum and the
albumin are rejected.
The above rule is a coordination rule and it should be noted that there are also
other types of rules that account for different kinds of variations:
1. insertion rules:  medullary carcinoma  Î medullary thyroid carcinoma
2. permutation rules: control center     Î center for disease control
The FASTR metagrammar for English contains 73 metarules altogether: 25
coordination rules, 17 insertion rules and 31 permutation rules. In any case, for
efficiency reasons the new rules are dyna mically generated. Each rule is linked
to a pattern extractor that permits a very quick acquisition of information. As has
been pointed out, the FASTR grammati cal formalism is a PATR-II extension
(Shieber, 1986). This language allows to write grammars using feature structures.
The rules describing terms are composed of a free-context part (N 1 → N2 N3) and 12 Aut omatic Term Detection: a Review of C urrent  Systems
a number of restriction equations (e.g. &lt;N 2 lemma&gt;= serum ). First, the system
filters the rules that are to be applied according to the given text and then an
analysis take place.
When Fastr is applied for term acquisition the process is gradual: from a given
set of terms the system detects new ones, which allows the beginning of a new
cycle and the detection of new candi dates. The loop goes on until new terms
cannot be detected. The author presents an experiment carried out on a medicine
corpus of 1,5 million words and a reference list of 70,000 terms from different
specialised domains. After 15 cycles 17,000 terms were detected of which 5,000
were new. The text was processed at a 2,562 word/minute speed.
However, the number of recognised terms decreases when the reference list has fewer items. For instance, if the reference sublist of medicine drops to 6,000
terms, then only 3,800 new terms are recognised.
The author also postulates the existence of a conceptual relation. between the
new terms and the term that has led to their recognition. This relationship is variable in accordance with th e type of rule that is applied i.e., insertion or
coordination rule. Permutation does not a llow any relationship due to the phrasal
nature of the relationship.
All the language dependent data used by Fa str is stored in separated text files.
This feature facilitates the us e of the system in other languages as showed by the
recent application of Fastr to Japa nese, German and Spanish/Catalan.
Recently Jacquemin has developed the de tection of semantic  variation using
resources like WordNet or the Microsoft Word97 thesaurus (Jacquemin, 1999).
Evaluation
The main characteristic of FASTR is its ability for detecting term variants, an
aspect often not considered by other systems. The fact of using already
recognised and accepted terms is very usef ul, although, as the author admits, it
places restrictions on the ac quisition of new terms that are not related to the
source terms.
TE in Fastr implies that terms that are a dded to the list of valid terms after each
cycle are not validated. Thus, a non-valid term may be added to the list so it is
likely that in forecoming cycles more non-valid terms are added. Jacquemin
(1996) believes that this is not an impor tant error source because the system, in
some way, corrects itself since “normally” non-correct candidates do not give
way to new potential candidate terms.
Actually this technique should not be isolately applied. Rather, it should be
coordinated with other strategies as in (Jacquin &amp; Liscouet 1996) and (Daille
1998).  AUT OMA TIC TERM DETECTION: A REVIEW  OF CURRENT  SYSTEMS

                                                          2.5. HEID
Reference publication:  Heid et al. (1996)
Main goal: Term extraction
Heid et al.  (1996) believe that automatic TE has various applications and
dictionary or glossary construction w ould be the major one. In dictionary
construction from computerized corpora two phases are distinguished: linguistic
pre-analysis and a term identification t ool. Each of these phases requires specific
computer tools.
In the linguistic pre-processing phase the following processes are required8:
a) tokenizing, which identifies word and sentence boundaries.
b) morphosyntactic analysis, which identifies grammatical categories as well as
distributional and morphosyntactic features.
c) POS tagging, which disambiguate morphosyntactic hypotheses.
d) lemmatization, which identifies the lemma candidates.
For term identification the system has a general corpus retrieval interface that
includes a corpus query processor (CQP), a macroprocessor for the CQP query
language and a key word in context (KWIC) program, to extract and sort
concordances and lists of absolute and relative frequency of search items.
TE is linked to a complex query langua ge. The queries will be different
according to the types of candidate term s searched for. Thus, for instance,
queries about single-word terms are made from morphemes or typical
components of compound or derived words (derivatives). In these queries it is
assumed that NP affixed terms from specialised languages use more specific
affixes and/or prefixes than others. A ll the word sequence ex tracted (N-A, N-N,
N-V), are based on POS patterns.
Heid et al.  (1996) have applied these tools to technical texts on automobile
engineering in German, which amounts to 35,000 words. The sample has been
manually analysed before the application of the above procedures. The results
are as follows:
• With regard to single-word terms, there has been found a 90% of candidate
terms and a 10% of silence. This rate  varies from one scheme to another.
• With regard to multiword terms, there are no concluding results. The results are less satisfactory and that the same problems as linguistic based are
found: POS patterns do not constrain enough the context and produce too
much noise. Heid et al.  (1996) believe that by using a syntactic parser, as it
is the case in English, noise would diminish.

8 Heid et al.  (1996) note that a broad coverage morphosynt actic parser for German is not attained.
Thus parser results are simulated using POS patterns.   14 Aut omatic Term Detection: a Review of C urrent  Systems
• Finally, collocation extraction is shown to produce noise but not silence,
since Heid et al.  (1996) consider the frequency criterion.
The Ahmad’s statistical measure (Ahmad et al , 1992) of relative frequency in
corpora of specialised and general language  is applied to this corpus of 35,000
words. They show that the results produced by linguistic corpus query are
included in the output of statistical methods. However noise in statistical
methods is higher than in linguistic methods.
Evaluation
To tackle this system it should be taken into account the morphosyntactic
features of the German language. Unlike Romance languages, German prefers to form compounds in a synthesising manner. It means that what other languages
express via terminological phrases in German is expressed with a single-word
term (by word is meant any segment found between two gaps). Thus it can be
seen that in German automatic term detection does not depend much on term
delimitation but on the terminological nature of a word. This is the reason why
we need parameters to distinguish a te rm from a word of the general language,
both having the same morphosyntactic structure.
Like most of the reviewed programs, Heid focuses on NP terms although it can also extract collocations combining nouns and verbs. In this case Heid et al.
(1996) note that the results are much worse. We do not have specific data about
the performance and the results of this system.
2.6. LEXTER
Reference publication:  Bourigault (1994)
Main goal: Term extraction
This system has been developed in the need of the EDF ( Electricité de France )
society for improving their indexation system. LEXTER aims at locating boundaries among which potentially terminological NPs could be isolated.
LEXTER carries a superficial analysis a nd makes use of the text heuristics in
order to obtain those NPs of maximum length that it regards as candidate terms.
The program is composed of several modules and works as follows:
1. Morphological analysis and disambiguation module . Texts receive information
about the POS and the lemma assigned to every word.
2. Delimitation module . At this stage a local syntactic analysis is carried so as to
split the text into maximal-length NPs. For example: alimentation en eau (water
supply),  pompe d’extraction  (extraction pump),  alimentation electrique de la
pompe de refoulement  (electric supply of the forcing back supply). Here the
system takes advantage of the negative knowledge about the parts of complex
terms. Thus those patterns of a potential term − finite verbs, pronouns and
conjunctions − that will never become part of a term are identified and considered AUT OMA TIC TERM DETECTION: A REVIEW  OF CURRENT  SYSTEMS
15

as boundaries. Some of these patterns are simple whereas others are complex
(sequences of preposition + determiner).
A French example of the latter would be SUR (prep) + LE (definite article): the
most common analysis is to propose that this sequence establishes a boundary
between NPs as in: on raccorde le câble d’alimentation du banc sur le  coffret de
décharge batterie. However there is a rate (10%) in which this sequence is part
of the term: action sur le  bouton poussoir de réarmement or action sur le
systeme d’alimentation de secours
To solve this and other similar situations, the system uses an endogenous
learning strategy of the patterns sub-categorisation. This strategy consists in
looking at the corpus to find those sequences of (noun) + sur + le  having
different contexts on the right hand side. Then non-productive nouns are weeded
out. Then sequences such as s ur + le  are considered sentence boundaries, except
for those cases wherein sequences are preceded by the productive noun located
in the learning phase. To see how this system works let us suppose that at a first
analysis the sequences below are found.
Le protection contre
Protection contre
il s’agit de maintenir la teneur en oxygène de cette eau dans
on procède à l’injection d’eau dans
on procède à l’injection d’eau dans
le système permet l’aiguillage des automates sur le gel est assurée par
les grands froids
les limites fixées
les limites fixées
les générateurs de vapeur
le prélèvement effectué
Then productive sequences are not regarded as term boundaries whereas non-productive sequences are viewed as extern al boundaries of the candidate term. In
the example above protection contre  and eau dans  do not become boundaries
whereas automates sur  does.
This strategy permits to detect a considerable amount of complex nouns which otherwise would have been lost. Unfortunately it also allows a great deal of
undesirable material (between 10% and 50%).
3. Splitting module . NPs are analysed and their constituents are divided into head
and expansion. For example the term candidate pompe d’extraction (extraction
pump)  is splitted into : pompe –head– (pump) + extraction – expansion–
(extraction).
At this point the system may find ambiguous situations such as “Noun Adj 1
Adj 2” and “Noun 1 Prep Noun 2 Adj” whose analysis is uncertain. To solve these
cases an endogenous learning process is followed which is similar to that
presented in the delimitation module.
4. Structuring module . The list of term candidates is organised in a
terminological network. This network can be produced only by looking at a list
of candidate terms and recognising the di fferent parts of each candidate term,
like in the following example: 16 Aut omatic Term Detection: a Review of C urrent  Systems
E expansion E expansion
N head
electric forcing back
head N’ electric supply  E expansion
E’ expansion N head N head

Addi tionally Lexter calculate som e product ivity figures based on l inks t ype
occurrences. These coefficien ts do not become filters, b ut are p assed on to the
terminologist as a piece of data so as to facilitate the evaluation of candidate
terms.
5. Navigation m odule. A consulting interface is built (called terminological
hypert ext) from  the source corpus, t he candi date term network and t he above-
mentioned coef ficients and lists.

2.7. NAULLEAU
Reference publication:  Naulleau (1998)
Main goal: Noun phrase filtering system
The model designed by Naulleau is a NP extraction system that proposes as term
candidates those sequences that comply with certain user tailored profile. The
whole process can be divided in two main stages: profile acquisition and profile
application.
To define its own profile the user chooses the set of phrases that s/he considers
relevant for his task and discards the ones that s/he does not consider useful at
that time. The data collect ed in such way is gene ralised according to their
morphological, syntactical and semantic characteristics dynamically creating a
set of positive and negative filters. A simple example of positive and negative
filters is the following:
(1) positive filter: metallic/automatic/nuclear/industrial taps
(2) negative filter: important/recent/necessary/unreliable taps
Then, those filters produced in the lear ning stage are applied to new sequences
analysed. As a result, some noun arguments and/or PPs can be eliminated. Thus a
NP can be divided or reduced and the resulting sequences are passed on to an
expert to be evaluated.
In doing so the author acknowledges the sociolinguistic nature of the term. It
implies that there is no linguistic model that can tell whether a NP is a term or
not beyond the scope of a field or even the application. Also, this procedure
introduces the idea of how relevant a phrase is in relation to the interest profile of
the user and assumes that such relevance may be evaluated on linguistic grounds.
This is a fully symbolic approach that uses the AlethIP engine that produces
sentences fully lemmatised, tagged and syntactically parsed. Then nouns and
adjectives are semantically tagged acco rding to both suffix information and
semantic data from AlethIP and using a set of contextual rules for the more
frequent and ambiguous words. The whole strategy is based on the evaluation of
the relevance of simple syntactic depende ncies. Such relevance is only based on
the data provided by the user.
According to the author, the results are encouraging. However it is difficult to
evaluate due to the practical problem posed by such a detailed evaluation. Some
additional experiments are described in (Nalleau, 1999).
Evaluation
This system may be considered the first one to use semantic data as a specific
resource for proposing term candidates. Also, as far as we know, is the first time
since the very beginning in the design of a TE systems that the user and the idea
of relevance to an application are taken into account. 18 Aut omatic Term Detection: a Review of C urrent  Systems
In this way the user may adapt the syst em to its specific needs but also its
intervention may crucially affect the performance of the system. The loss of
specific data makes difficult to evaluate the tool behaviour in an actual context.
2.8. NEURAL
Reference publication:  Frantzi and Ananiadou (1995)
Main goal: Term extraction
Neural is a system for TE of a hybrid nature, that is it uses both linguistic
(morphosyntactic patterns and a list of suffixes specific to the domain) and
statistically knowledge (frequency and mutual information). Frantzi &amp;
Ananiadou (1995) pays special attention to two different problems: detection of
nested terms and detection of low frequency terms using statistical methods.
The test bench is a corpus of 55,000 words in the domain of medicine
(ophthalmology). The structures analysed are Noun-Noun and Adjective-Noun
that are identified using a standard tagger. The list of suffixes includes those
frequently found in terminological units in the field of ophthalmology like -oid, -
oma, - ium. The system is implemented using a Back-Propagation (BP) two
layers neural network. The threshold has b een set to .5 but this may vary. The BP
neural network has been trained with a set of 300 compounds and the tests were
made with another set of 300 words. It obtained a success rate of 70 %.
The author and other scholars from the Manchester Metropolitan University have
been active since 1995 developing specific statistical figures for TE. In this way
it is necessary to mention those tasks related to the adding of context information
(Frantzi, 1997, Maynard &amp; Ananiadou, 1999). Usually the context is discarded
or, alternatively, considered as a bag of words although its relevance is signalled
by many scholars. Here the basic assumption is that terms tend to appear
grouped in real text, so the termhood figure of a candidate would increase if there are other terms (or candidates highly ranked) in the context.
Both Frantzi, 1997 and Maynard &amp; Ananiadou, 1999 propose a similarity figure based on the distance between the candidate and the context words (nouns,
adjectives and verbs). This figure is calculated by Frantzi (1997) using statistical
and syntactic information while Maynard &amp; Ananiadou (1999) include also
semantic information from a specialised thesaurus (UMLS semantic Network).
In Maynard &amp; Ananiadou (1999) this similarity figure may also be used to take
into account some kind of semantic disambiguation for the sense that gets a
better value. A context factor (CF) is added to the figure already used to rank the
candidates (Cvalue) and thus reorderi ng the set of candidates as follows:
SNCvalue(a) = 0.8*Cvalue(a) + 0.2*CF(a). The authors report improvements in
the ranking of term candidates from his eye pathology corpus.
Evaluation AUT OMA TIC TERM DETECTION: A REVIEW  OF CURRENT  SYSTEMS
19

The original system can be seen as a standard hybrid system. The linguistic
knowledge includes Greek and Latin affixes and morphosyntactic patterns. The
incorporation of this kind of suffixes should be highly productive. However the
chosen patterns may well apply to English but not to Romance Languages.
The incorporation of the context as part of the data available for evaluating the
termhood of a candidate is a very interesting contribution to the behaviour of
terms in real texts. It should also serve to increase the relevance of low frequency
candidates but no specific figure is given.
It is necessary to mention the use of semantic information as a kind of resource that is increasingly used in the TE field.
2.9. NODALIDA-95
Reference publication : Arppe (1995)
Main goal : Term extraction
NODALIDA, a product designed by the Lingsoft firm, is based on an enhanced
version of NPtool that is a program de veloped at the Department of General
Linguistics at the Helsinki Univers ity (Finland). NPtool (V outilanen 1993)
generates lists of NPs occurring in the sentences of a text and provides an
assessment about whether these phrases are candidates terms or not (ok/?). From
these lists all the acceptable sub-chains ar e obtained. Besides, the source list is
multiplied. Let us see an actual example, for the sentence: “ exact form of the
correct theory of quantum gravity “ NPtool proposes the following additional
NPs:
form of the correct theory of quantum  gravity  form   correct theory
exact form of the correct theory    exact form   gravity
form of the correct theory     theory  quantum gravity
Simultaneously there are a number of premises that become the first filter like in
the following: “Those NPs preceded by a determiner, adjective or prefixed
sentence ( kind of, some, one, ... ) are weeded out.”
As for the remaining NPs, their occurren ce frequency is calculated. Further, they
are ordered and grouped according to thei r grammatical head and are presented
to the terminologist together with thei r context. The NPtool module (V outilanen,
1993) is at the heart of the system. It is a NP detector largely based on the
constraint grammar formalism (Karlsson, 1990). Its main features are: (1)
Morphological/syntactical descriptions are based on a large set of hand-coded
linguistic rules, (2) both the grammar and the lexicon allow a corpus analysis
with non-controlled text and (3) disa mbiguation is made according to only
linguistic criteria. As a result, between 3% and 6% of the words remain
ambiguous. 20 Aut omatic Term Detection: a Review of C urrent  Systems
The text goes through a previous process so as to determine sentence boundaries,
idiomatic expressions, compound forms, typographical signs, etc. Then it is
morphologically analysed and a result like this is obtained9:
(“&lt;*the&gt;”  (“the” DET CE NTRAL ART SG/PL (@&gt;N)))
(“&lt;inlet&gt;”  (“inlet” N NOM SG))
(“&lt;and&gt;”  (“and” CC (@CC)))
(“&lt;exhaust&gt;” (“exhaust” &lt;SVO&gt;  V SUBJUNCTIVE VFIN (@V))
   (“exhaust” &lt;SVO&gt; V IMP VFIN (@V))
   (“exhaust” &lt;SVO&gt; V INF)
   (“exhaust” &lt;SVO&gt; V PRES -SG3 VFIN (@V))
   (“exhaust” N NOM SG))
(“&lt;manifold&gt;” (“manifold” N NOM PL))
At this moment disambiguation takes place. For example in the sentence: ” The
inlet and exhaust manifolds are mounted on opposite sides of the cylinder head “
two analyses are obtained:
(1) on/@AH opposite/@N side s/@NH of/@N&lt; the/@&gt;N cylinder/@NH  head/@V
(2) on/@AH opposite/@N side s/@NH of/@N&lt; the/@&gt;N cylinder/@&gt;N  head/@NH
What distinguishes these two analyses is the consideration of whether the final sequence ( cylinder head) is a NP or not. The ongoing process gives only two
possible analyses for each sentence. First, those NPs of a maximal length are
preferred ( NP-friendly ) and, second, those NPs of a minimal length are preferred
(NP-hostile ). Then the system compares both strategies and labels each NP as
ok/? by considering whether the analysis is shared or not by both strategies
Thus the last sentence gets this analysis below:
(3) ok : inlet and exhaust manifolds   ?: opposite sides of the cylinder
ok: exhaust manifolds     ? :  opposite sides of the cylinder head
In order to validate this additional information the terminologist is provided with
a list of candidate terms. The results reported by the NPtool module are pretty
good (precision=95-98% and r ecall=98.5-100%) with a text of about 20 Kwords.
Evaluation
NODALIDA is based on the use of linguistic knowledge through a structural
approach (i.e., detection of phrasal structures and structural disambiguation).
Arppe (1995) presents high-quality results. However, the corpus should be
enlarged, since so far tests have been made  on quite small corpora. It is not clear
how precision and recall figures are calculated, particularly how to determine
which terms are deemed to be correct (i.e., those which have the ok signal or all
of them). Also it should be stressed that NODALIDA has not been tested using the NPtool enhanced version in an actual situation of terminology problems.

9 The meaning of the syntactic function tags are: @&gt;N = pre-modifier; @&lt;N = post-modifier; @CC
and @CS= coordination and subor dination conjunction; @V = Verb; @NH = nominal head. Finally,
“&gt;” and “&lt;” indicate the direction of the phrasal head. AUT OMA TIC TERM DETECTION: A REVIEW  OF CURRENT  SYSTEMS
21

Taking into account that the disambiguator is one of the main error sources in
this kind of systems, Arppe (1995) belie ves that a high-degree quality is achieved
despite the fact that there are no data about terminology extraction in real
situations. Besides, to achieve this quality NODALIDA proposes a great deal of
rules, which yields management and control overhead.
The list that is passed on to the terminologist to be validated comprises those
candidates signalled with ok and ?. The way in which potential NPs are obtained
by the system leads us to suspect that  there are many candidate terms in the
validation list that the terminologist has to analyse.
2.10. TERMIGHT
Reference publication:  Dagan and Church (1994)
Main goal: Translation aid
Termight is currently used by A&amp;T Business Translation Systems. It was created
to be a tool for automating some stages of the professional translator
terminological research.
To do so it starts with a tagged and disambiguated text as well as a list of
predetermined syntactic patterns that could be adjusted to every document. Thus,
a list of candidate terms is obtained comprising one or more words. Single-word
candidates are defined as all those words that are not included in a previously
determined list of empty words (i.e. stop list). Multiword terms are referred to
one of the predetermined syntactic patte rns via regular expressions. Dagan and
Church (1994) considered only noun sequences patterns.
Candidate terms are grouped and classifi ed according to their lemma (i.e. the
right hand side noun) and frequency. Thos e candidates sharing the same lemma
are classified alphabetically in accord ance with the inverse order of their
compounding words. Thus it is showed the order of changes of the English
simple NPs.
For each candidate term the corresponding concordances are obtained, which are
alphabetically classified acco rding to their context. Th is information enables the
terminologist to evaluate  whether each candidate is appropriate or not.
Dagan and Church (1994) note that the rate of term list construction is of 150 and 200 terms per hour, which is twice faster than the average. As for the
extraction quality, they state that, un like exclusively statistical methods,
Termight permits to extract low-frequency terms.
Moreover this system has a bilingual module which, via statistical methods,
obtains a word-level alignment from texts. Thus terms found in language A are
referred to their counterparts in language B. This well-ordered list of candidate
terms is again passed on to the terminologist to be evaluated. 22 Aut omatic Term Detection: a Review of C urrent  Systems
The Termight bilingual module does not seem to be developed and tested as the
basic one. Tests have been made on 192 terms from a technical manual in
English and German. The correct translation is found in the first suggested
solution in 40% of the cases, whereas only 7% corresponds to the correct
translation suggested in the second place.  As for the remaining, the correct
translation was in other places of the proposal list.
Evaluation
Termight is a remarkable system in that  there is an accurate classification and
presentation of candidate terms and it does not attempt to become an automatic
system. Rather, it helps the translator.
However, it presents a number of shortcomings: (1) The only syntactic pattern
considered is very simple: noun sequences . This pattern may well be valid for
English but not for Romance languages and (2) no numerical information about the recognition quality is given. The ty pe of pattern considered may suppose
high precision but low recall

2.11. TERMINO
Reference publication:  Plante and Dumas (1989)
Main goal: Facilitation of the term extraction terminographer’s task.
The TERMINO program is composed of several tools to facilitate TE in French.
It is a help for the terminologist insofar as the identification of those discourse
units that denominate notions or objects. Besides it provides every unit with the
immediate context from which data relevant to the notions denominated by
theses units can be obtained. There are a number of TERMINO versions which improve in some ways previous ones.
This tool is based mainly on linguistic knowledge and it comprises 3 sub-systems: a pre-editor, which separate s texts into words and sentences and
identifies proper nouns, a morphosyntactic parser and a record-drafting facility.
The text does not get any special treatment: it is only required to be codified in ASCII form.
With regard to term delimitation and extraction the more interesting sub-system
is the morphosyntactic parser. It consists of 3 modules: a morphological parser; a
syntactic parser and a synapsy detector.
The morphological parser has two functions: a) automatic categorisation; b)
lemma and tag identification. According to Plante and Dumas, 30% of words in French can be attributed to more than one category. This has led to the tagging of
all the possible categories for each word. As a result, there is an overproduction
of words with different tags. Categorisation and lemmatisation are obtained from
the application of the LCML program, it is not a dictionary but a morphological
parser of lexical forms so it can correc tly lemmatise and tag new lexical forms. AUT OMA TIC TERM DETECTION: A REVIEW  OF CURRENT  SYSTEMS
23

The syntactic parser is responsible for weeding out the vast majority of
ambiguities generated in previous stages . It is managed through the construction
of a syntactic structure for each sentence.
Finally, the synapsy detector (MRSF) selects, among the syntactic units from the parser, those lexical noun units that are likely to be terms. S. David (David and
Plante, 1991) created MRSF especially for TERMINO. MRSF is based on
principles of noun group construction. Da vid’s understanding of synapsy is that
of a polylexical unit of a syntactic nature that is the head of the NP. Thus,
synapsies are only NPs groups: some of them will become terms and some of
them will not. Further, some of them will only be “topics” that will enable the
terminologist to know different concepts or grasp an overview of the text topics.
The MRSF module comprises 5 sub-modules: (1) head hunter module; (2)
expansion recogniser module; (3) categor isation module; (4) synapsy generator
module and (5) representation and evaluation module.
TERMINO has a set of software tools, which is much larger and comprises different modules that allow to manipulate terminological data. These tools help
the terminologist decide whether a synapsy is a term or not, elaborate
terminological filing forms and create terminological databases.
TERMINO recognises between 70% and 74% of the complex terms. The fact that 30% of terms are not recognised by TERMINO can be explained by
coordination (it is a signal of segment breaking), acronyms and common nouns
in capital letters. Moreover, there is 28% of noise, of which 47% is due to a
wrong mark-up and a 53% is due to sy napsies belonging to general language.
Evaluation
TERMINO is one of the first candidate term extractors that worked and it is a
linguistically-based extractor, composed of different independent modules. This
system is based on the concept of synapsy . The synapsy detector is based on the
establishment of a number of heuristic rules that may well be increased provided
the corpus is delimited.
There is a need to improve this system taking into account that it is still too noisy
(28%), which could be improved, for example, with a different treatment of
capital letters and acronyms.
2.12. TERMS
Reference publication:  Justeson and Katz (1995)
Main goal: Term extraction
Justeson and Katz (1995) hold the following views about terms:
a) Terminological noun phrases (TNP) are different from non-terminological noun phrases (nTNP) in that the modifiers of the first ones are much shorter than
those of the second ones. 24 Aut omatic Term Detection: a Review of C urrent  Systems
b) An entity introduced by a nTNP can be later referred to only by the head of the
NP and often by other NP (synonyms, hyponyms, hyperonyms). By contrast, an
entity introduced by a TNP is normally rep eated identically in a given document,
as a single omission of a modifier could yield a change of the referred entity.
c) In technical texts lexical NPs ar e almost exclusively terminological.
d) Multiword technical terms are near ly always composed of nouns and
adjectives (97%) and some prepositions (3%) between two NPs.
e) The average length of a TNP is of 1.91 words.
The proposed filter finds strings with a frequency equal or higher than two. These strings follow with this regul ar expression: ((A|N)+ | ((A|N)*(N
P)?)(A|N)*N. Those candidate terms of a length of 2 (2 patterns: AN and NA)
and 3 (5 patterns: AAN, ANN, NAN, NNN and NPN) are by far the most
commonly encountered.
The purpose of this algorithm is to combine good coverage of the usual
terminology from technical texts with high quality in the extraction phase. The
algorithm prefers quality to coverage, since if it only made use of the
grammatical constraints then the system would propose many irrelevant NPs.
The vast majority of relevant NPs overcome the frequency constraint.
Selection of grammatical patterns also affects quality. If prepositions are admitted within the pattern many candi dates are introduced, although few will be
valid. As a result, quality decreases whereas quantity increases and, accordingly,
Justeson and Katz (1995) prefer not to take prepositions into consideration.
The implementation of grammatical patterns also affects the quality/coverage
trade-off. There are two ways in which a given linguistic unit is attributed to a
grammatical category: disambiguation and filtering. The first one is rejected
because disambiguators are not totally reliable yet.
Filtering consist in parsing and lemmatisi ng each word of the text. Then those
sequences following the pattern are consid ered. If a word is not identified as a
noun, adjective or preposition, it is dis carded. Thus each word maintains its
nominal, adjectival and prepositional values and in this order. The chain is
weeded out if more than one word can be identified as a preposition or if it does
not follow the pattern (e.g. if the pattern ends with a noun and there is more than
one preposition then the word following the preposition is not a noun).
Filtering has a coverage at least as good as what can be attained by a standard
tagger. However, quality is not that good (e.g. fixed  is only identified as an
adjective – bug fixed –, but it can also become a verb: fixed disk drive ). In
contrast, filtering is much faster than parsing.
In any case, Justeson and Katz (1995) suggest to control the patterns, the list of
grammatical words and the frequency to ad just the performance of the system to
each type of text. AUT OMA TIC TERM DETECTION: A REVIEW  OF CURRENT  SYSTEMS
25

This system has been applied to different domains (metallurgy, spatial
engineering and nuclear energy) and it is used at IBM Translation Center. The
TERMS results are presented on the basis of 3 technical texts (statistical
classification of patterns, lexical semantics and chromatography). Coverage has
only been estimated for one of the text and it is of 71%. Quality has been
estimated between 77% and 96% of the instances.
Evaluation
Although Justeson and Katz (1995) present a detailed study on the performance of terminological units (wherein there are some overstatements), the proposed
filter does not seem to take advantage of these previous analyses of terms.
Further, it should be noted that this type of filtering based on quite simple
patterns would not be so efficient if they were applied to languages other than
English such as Romance languages. Also, this kind of patterns produces a lot of
noise.
3. Contrastive Analysis
Here we will contrast the systems’ ma in features, according to six relevant
aspects when designing a new detection system of terminological units:
linguistic resources, strategies of term de limitation, strategies of term filtering,
classification of recognised terms and obtained results. For some of these criteria
we have created a table containing the mo st significant data so as to make the
system comparison easier.
3.1. Linguistic resources
It has been observed that the vast majority of the reviewed systems make use of
some sort of linguistic information, at least a list of empty words taken as
boundaries. The standard process includes a morphological analysis followed by
some kind of disambiguation system. The systems altering this procedure are the
following:
a. ANA: does not use any linguistic resource, just a list of auxiliary words
b. TERMS: use its own disambiguation system: POS filtering
c. Naulleau: introduces semantic information
Additionally, for the systems that use an incremental strategy, like ANA and
Fastr, it is necessary a set of in itial terms to bootstrap the process.
3.2. Strategies of term delimitation
All systems of terminology extraction have to determine at some point the beginning and the end of the candidate term, that is, delimit the potential
terminological unit. The reviewed programs have different strategies to delimit 26 Aut omatic Term Detection: a Review of C urrent  Systems
terms: word-boundary elements, structural patterns, syntactic parser, text
distribution, typographical elements, term lists, structure disambiguation. Below
we show a summary of the differen t options adopted by each system:

3.3. Strategies of term filtering
Term filtering is a key stage of any term detection system. This means that the
list of candidates is reduced as much as possible. The following table shows the
strategies found in all the reviewed systems:

3.4. Classification of recognised terms
Some of the analysed systems classify recognised terms by grouping them
according to some criteria. Thus, the related terms stay close to each other. Even
FASTR attempts to infer an ontology from the recognised terms. Those systems
which show some classification of recognised terms are the following:
a. ANA: it builds a semantic netw ork from the detected terms.
b. FASTR: it builds a graph to relate recognised terms. Also it proposes the
construction of partial ontologies for some terms.
c. LEXTER: it builds a terminological network splitting terms into head and
expansion.

4. </introduction>
  <corps>In the late 80s there was an acute need , from different disciplines and goals, to
automatically extract terminological units from specialised texts. In the 90s large
computerised textual corpora have been constructed resulting in the first programs for terminology extraction
1 (henceforth TE) which have showed
encouraging results.
Throughout the current decade computa tional linguists, applied linguists,
translators, interpreters, scientific journalists and computer engineers have been
interested in automatically isolating terminology from texts. There are many
goals that have led these different profe ssional groups to design software tools so
as to directly extract terminology from texts: building of glossaries, vocabularies
and terminological dictionaries; text indexing; automatic translation; building of

* In Bourigault, D.; Jacquemin, C.; L’Homme, M-C. (2001) Recent Advances in Computational
Terminology , 53-88.
1 In order to give a broa der view of TE we use both extractor  and detector  to refer to the same notion.
However, we are aware of the fact that some schol ars attribute different meanings to these words. 2 Aut omatic Term Detection: a Review of C urrent  Systems
knowledge databases; construction of hype rtext systems; construction of expert
systems and corpus analysis.
From the appearance of TERMINO (the first broadly known term detector) in
1990 until today a number of projects to design different types of automatic
terminology detectors have been carried out to assist terminological work.
However, despite the large number of studies in progress, the automatisation of
the terminological extraction phase is still fraught with problems. The main
problems encountered by term extractors are: (1) identification of complex terms, that is, determining where a terminological phrase begins and ends; (2) recognition of complex terms, that is, deciding whether a discursive unit
constitutes a terminological phrase or a free unit; (3) identification of the
terminological nature of a lexical unit, that is, knowing whether in a specialised
text a lexical unit has a terminological na ture or belongs to general language and
(4) appropriateness of a terminological unit to a given vocabulary (this has
scarcely been addressed from the point of view of automatization).
Systems for TE are based on three types of knowledge: (a) linguistic; (b) statistical; (c) hybrid (statistical and linguistic). Hence, there are different
approaches to automatic term detecti on. All systems analyse a corpus of
specialised texts in electronic form and extract lists of word chunks (i.e.
candidate terms) that are to be confirmed by the terminologist. To make the terminologist’s task easier the candidate term is provided with its context and,
when available, with any other furt her information (freque ncy, relationship
between terms, etc.)
Two relevant aspects regarding the nature of terms are termhood and
unithood2; TE systems may be designed based on only one of these two aspects.
Some practical experiments following each scheme for ranking a set terms
extracted from Japanese texts are presented in (Nakagawa &amp; Mori, 1998). They show that results in precision and recall are very close but the set of terms
extracted are a somewhat different. This is still a research issue.
Alongside term detection we find the task of automatic document indexing (i.e.
information retrieval, IR). This applied field of natural language processing
(NLP) techniques has an interesting common point with automatic term
detection, that is, word chunks that index a given document are often
terminological units. This same goal explains why many extraction systems are
rooted on IR as well as on the analys is of a specific IR system with no
application whatsoever to TE.

2 (Kageura &amp; Umino, 1996) refer to unithood  as the degree of stability of  syntagmatic combinations
(collocations) and termhood  as the degree in that a linguistic unit is related to a domain-specific
concept. AUT OMA TIC TERM DETECTION: A REVIEW  OF CURRENT  SYSTEMS  3

The difference between these two approaches lies in the fact that a tool for TE
should extract all terminological units from a te xt, whereas IR focuses on the
extraction of only words or word sequences that better describe the contents of
the document regardless of their grammatical features.
The standard approach to IR consists in processing documents so as to extract the so-called indexing terms . These terms are usually isolated words containing
enough semantic load to provide information about its goodness when describing
documents. Queries are processed in  a similar fashion to extract query terms .
With regard to queries the relevance of documents is based exclusively on their
representing terms. This is the reason why their choice is crucial.
Often these indexing terms are single words although it is known that isolated
words are seldom relevant enough to decide the semantic value of a document
with regard to the query. This fact has given rise to the ever-growing appearance,
in the TREC3 assessments, of word and word-sequence indexing systems using
NLP techniques.
Statistically based systems function by de tecting two or more lexical units whose
occurrence is higher than a given level. This is not a random situation, but it is
related to a particular usage of these lexical units. This principle, called Mutual
Information , also applies to other science domains such as telecommunications
and physics. Term detectors based on hybrid knowledge tend to use this idea
prior to a linguistic-based processing.
The problem with this kind of approach  is that there are low-frequency terms
difficult to be managed by extraction systems. Here it is important to note that
these systems use basically numerical information and thus are prone to be
language-independent. The two most frequen tly used measures in the assessment
of these systems are found in IR: recall  and precision . Recall is defined as the
relationship between the sum of retrieved terms and the sum of existing terms in
the document that is being explored. In contrast precision accounts for the
relationship between those extracted terms that are really terms and the aggregate
of candidate terms that are found. These measures can be interpreted as the
capacity of the detection system to  extract all terms from a document ( recall ) and
the capacity to discriminate between those units detected by the system which
are terms and those which are not ( precision ). The fact that recall accounts for all
terms from a document implies that it is a figure much more difficult to estimate
and improve than precision.
In contrast with this traditional approach, other approaches attempt to solve the problem by using linguistic knowledge, which may include two types of
information:

3 TREC ( Text Retrieval Engineering Conference ) refers to a series of conferences supported by NIST
and DARPA (U.S. agencies). Further information can be found at: http://trec.nist.gov/ . 4 Aut omatic Term Detection: a Review of C urrent  Systems
a) Term specific: it consists in the detection of the recurrent patterns from
complex terminological units such as  noun-adjective and noun-preposition-noun.
This calls for the use of regular expressions  and techniques of finite state
automata.
b) Language generic: it consists in the use of more complex systems of NLP that
start with the detection of more basic linguistic structures: noun phrase (NP),
prepositional phrase (PP), etc.
In both approaches each word is associated to a morphological category. In order
to do so different strategies are proposed: from coarse systems that do not make
use of any dictionary to complex syst ems that have an extremely detailed
morphological analysis and a final phase of disambiguation.
Systems that harness structural information resort to techniques of partial
analysis to detect potentially terminologi cal phrasal structures. There are also
systems that benefit from their understanding of what is a non-term so they are at
some point in between those systems already mentioned. Other systems try to
reutilize current terminological databases to find terms, variants or new terms.
Systems based on linguistic knowledge tend to use noise  and silence as a
measure of its efficiency. Noise attempts to assess the rate between discarded
candidates and accepted ones; silence attemp ts to assess those terms contained in
an analysed text that are not detected  by the system. Noise is common problem
of those systems using this approach. Errors in the assignation of morphological category are also shared by these systems.
The type of knowledge used leads to language-specific systems and therefore it
requires a prior linguistic analysis and probably a redesign of many parts of the
system. Knowledge in artificial intelligence has been traditionally obtained from
experts in each domain. This has yielde d several difficulties so that some
scholars have focused on automatization and systematisation in knowledge
acquisition. This strategy seems to show the benefits of a terminological
approach. Thus some researchers (e.g . Condamines, 1995) have proposed the
construction of terminological knowledge da tabases so as to include linguistic
knowledge in traditional databases. Although this is a recent a pproach, there is
no database yet containing all the features that could be used in TE, i.e. there is
hardly any semantic information. Thus closed lists of words containing sparse
semantic information within a given specialised domain have been proposed.
In this paper we attempt to analyse the main systems of terminology extraction in
order to describe its current status and thus  be able to enrich them. This paper is
divided up into two main parts: firstly, the largest part is devoted to describe
various systems of terminology extraction together with a short evaluation in
which weak and strong points have been  outlined. Secondly, the terminology
extraction systems have been classifi ed according to some parameters.  AUT OMA TIC TERM DETECTION: A REVIEW  OF CURRENT  SYSTEMS  5

2. Description of some terminology extraction systems
In the following sections we offer a critical description of number of
semiautomatic terminology extraction systems. In all cases, the following
information is given:
a) The reference data of the system, that  is, the author and the publication where
the tool is first mentioned and the system goal.
b) A brief description of the system.
c) A short evaluation of the most relevant aspects. This evaluation is mainly based on papers, oral presentations in  congresses and working papers, etc.
2.1. ANA
Reference publication:  Enguehard and Pantera (1994)
Main goal: Term extraction
ANA (Automatic Natural Acquisition) ha s been developed in accordance with
the following design principles: non-utilis ation of linguistic knowledge, dealing
with written and oral texts (interview  transcripts) and non-concern about
syntactic errors.
According to the current trend of harnessing statistical techniques in the study of
natural language, scholars use Mutual Information as a measure of lexical
association4. In order to avoid the involvement of linguistic knowledge the
concept of “flexible string recognition” is created, which generates a
mathematical function so as to determine the degree of similarity between words.
Thus, no tool for morphological analysis is needed. For instance, the string
colour of painting  represents other similar strings like: colour of paintings ,
colour of this painting , colour of any painting , etc. The system has neither a
dictionary nor a grammar.
The architecture of ANA is composed of 2 modules: a familiarity module and a discovery module. The first module determines the following 3 groups of words,
which constitute the only required knowledge for term detection:
a. function words (i.e. empty words): a, any , for, in, is, of, to...
b. scheme words (i.e. words establishing semantic relationships) such as box of
nails , where the preposition shows some kind of relationship between box and
nails .
c. bootstrap (i.e. set of terms that cons titutes the kernel of the system and the
starting point for term detection).
The second module consists in a gradua l acquisition process of new terms from
existing ones. Further, links between detected terms are automatically generated

4 Remarkable examples of the use of these tec hniques are the works of Church &amp; Hanks (1989) on
word association and Smadja (1991) on co llocation extraction from large corpora. 6 Aut omatic Term Detection: a Review of C urrent  Systems
to build a sem antic network. This module is based on word co-occurrence that
can have 3 t ypes of i nterpret ations:
• expression : high-frequency  existing term s (T EXP) in the sam e window . The new
word i s consi dered a new t erm and t hus i s included in the semantic network. For
instance if the system  has diesel and engine as a known t erms and fi nds
sequences like: ... the diesel engine is... or ... this diesel engine has... Then the
sequence diesel engi ne is accepted as a new term  and is included in the semantic
network as a new node wi th links t o diesel and engine (see figure below).
• candi date: an existing term  appears frequently (TCAND) together wi th anot her
word and a schem e word as in: ... any shade  of wood... or ... this shade  of
colour ... Here shade  becom es a new term  and is placed in a new node of the
semantic network (see fi gure bel ow).
• expansi on: an existing term  appears freq uently (T EXPA) in the sam e word
sequence, without including an y schem e word: ... use any  soft woods  to... or ...
this soft woods  or... As a result, soft wo od is in corporated into the term  list an d
the sem antic network as a new node wi th a link to woods  (see fi g. 1 bel ow).
The system  keeps on recursively
seeking elem ents with the three
interpretatio ns alread y m entioned
until a new term  is found.
Enguehard and Pant era (1994)
tested it by processi ng a docum ent
in Engl ish of around 25,000 words

2.2. CLARIT5
Refer ence publication:  Evans and Zhai  (1996)
Main goal : Docum ent indexi ng

5 Further infor mation can be found at: http://www .clarit.com . AUT OMA TIC TERM DETECTION: A REVIEW  OF CURRENT  SYSTEMS  7

Docum ent indexi ng for IR  is an i mportant field of appl ication of NLP
techni ques. This branch holds common points with term detection si nce t he word
sequences t hat help in docum ent indexi ng are norm ally terminological units too.
CLARIT belongs t o the group of sy stems that advocat e an elaborat ed textual
processing to detect com plex terms in order to reach a m ore appropriate
descri ption of docum ents. This is the reason why  we have i ncluded t his system
amongst  terminology detectors.
Evans and Zhai  (1996) propose t he fol lowing ki nd of phrases for indexat ion
purposes:
1. lexical atoms (hot dog, stainless steel , data base , on line, ...)
2. head m odifier pai rs (treated strip , ...)
3. subcom pounds ( stainless steel strip , ...)
4. cross-preposi tion m odification pai rs (quality su rface vs. quality o f surface)
The methodol ogy starts with the morphol ogical anal ysis of words and t he
detection of noun phrases (NPs). The sy stem distinguishes si mplex noun phrases
from  cross-preposi tion si mplex phrases.
What is behi nd this is the introduct ion of statistics to corpus linguistics. Statistics
here focuses on docum ents, that is, there is no pri or training corpus. Linguistic
knowledge facilitates the calculation weedi ng out irrelevant st ructures, im proves
the reliab ility o f statistical d ecisio ns and adjusts th e statistical p arameters.
The whol e process i s showed i n the figure bel ow:
First, th e raw tex t is parsed so as to
extract NPs. Then each NP  is
recursively parsed  with the purpose
of finding t he m ost secure
groupi ngs. In t his phase l exical
atom s are also detected and NPs
are structured. Finally at the
generat ion phase t he rem aining
compounds are obt ained.
Lexical atom s are defined as
sequences of t wo or m ore words
constituting a sin gle semantic unit
such as space sh uttle, part of
speech  and hot dog . Since the
detection of t hese uni ts is fraught
with probl ems two heuri stical rules are proposed:  Figure 2 Whole process in CLARIT NPs

b. When act ing as NP , lexical atoms hardl y allow the insertion of words. 8 Aut omatic Term Detection: a Review of C urrent  Systems
The first condition takes place if the frequency of the target pair W1W2 is higher
than any other pair from the NP that is  being processed. In the second condition
the frequencies of grouped and separated o ccurrences are compared and there is
a threshold beyond which the association is weeded out. This threshold is
variable according to the function of  sentence morphological category. In
English texts, the most favoured sequence is that of noun-noun.
NP analysis is also a recursive proce ss. At every new phase the most recent
lexical atoms are used for finding new associations that will be used in the
following phase. The process keeps going until the whole NP is analysed. Let us
consider the example below:
general purpose high performance computer
general purpose [high performance]  computer
[general purpose]  [high performance] computer
[general purpose] [[high performance] computer]
[[general purpose] [[high performance] computer]]
The grouping order shows those sequences with a more reliable association
score. In order to determine the association score a number of rules are taken into
account:
• Lexical atoms are given score 0 as well as adverb combination with
adjective, past participles and progressive verbs,
• Syntactically impossible pairs are given score 100 (noun-adjective, noun-
adverb, adjective-ad jective, etc.).
• As to the remaining pairs, there is a formula that account for the frequency
of each word, the association score of this word with other words from the
NP and of two random parameters.
To increase its reliability the association score is recomputed after every
assignation association. The sy stem has been tested in an actual retrieval task of
document indexing substituting the defau lt NLP module in the CLARIT system.
The corpus and the queries were the st andards used in the TREC conferences.
There have been noticed some improveme nts in recall as well as in precision,
which, in the author’s opinion, justifies the use of these techniques. Then in the
TREC-5 report a more detailed evaluation of the system is made (Zhai et al.
1996). All in all it is concluded that the use of these techniques is effective, which enforces the similarities between term indexing and terminology extraction.

Evaluation
This seems to be an interesting system and the applicability of some basic ideas to terminology detection appears to be feasible. Actually CLARIT holds
similarities with the Daille’s (1994) propos al (a linguistically-driven statistics). AUT OMA TIC TERM DETECTION: A REVIEW  OF CURRENT  SYSTEMS  9

It should be borne in mind, however, that problems of terminology extraction
and document indexing are similar but no identical so that many decisions
should be re-considered strictly from the point of view of term detection. It is
also noteworthy that this system only extracts NP terminological units and the
data provided about how this system works are related to the application for
which it has been designed.
2.3. Daille-94 (ACABIT)
Reference publication:  Daille (1994)
Main goal: Term extraction
The main idea behind this system is to combine linguistic knowledge with
statistical measures. Here the corpus should contain all the morphological
information. Then a list of candidate terms is created according to text sequences
that provide syntactic patterns of term formation. This information uses
statistical methods to filter out this list. This final process is different from other
systems in that it only uses linguistic resources.
Assuming the fact that all terminologi cal banks are basically composed of
compound nouns, the program focuses on the detection of binary compound
nouns  and disregards other co-occurring categories. This assumption lies in the
fact that there is a large number of this kind of nouns in specialised languages. Further, most of these compounds of 3 or  more constituents can be treated in a
binary form.
Those patterns considered relevant for French are N 1 PREP (DET) N 2 and N
ADJ PREP à (DET) N 2, together with right and left coordination. Statistical
algorithms are applied to these patterns. The author is aware of  the fact that the
application of statistical measures leads to some noise rate, that is, low-frequency
terms will not be recognised.
The technique used for pattern recognition is that of finite state automata.
Automata are represented by a subset of grammatical tags to which some lemmas, inflected forms and a punctuation mark are added. Thus we can regard
automata as linguistic filters that select  defined patterns and also determine their
occurrence frequency, distance and variation. Each morphosyntactic pattern is associated with a speci fic finite automaton.
The corpus is given a statistical treatment based on a large number of statistical
measures, which are grouped in the following classes: frequency measures,
association criteria, diversity criteria a nd distance measures. The starting point is
considering the two lemmas that constitu te a pair within a pattern as two
variables on which the dependence degree is measured. Data are represented in a
standard contingency table: 10 Aut omatic Term Detection: a Review of C urrent  Systems

 L2 Ln where a = L 1L2 occurrences
L1 A b  b = L 1+Ln (n≠2) occurrences
Lm C d  c = L m+L2 (m≠1) occurrences
    d = L m+Ln (m≠1 and n≠ 2)
Eighteen measures are applied with th e aim of establishing the degree of
independence of the variables in the contingency table. The analysis of the
results shows that only four of these measures are relevant to the purpose:
frequency, cubed association criterion6 (IM3), likelihood criterion,
Fager/MacGowan criterion.
Evaluation
Unlike in other systems, in ACABIT frequency has turned out to be one of the
most important measures for term detection from a given area. However, the
classification resulting from the application of this frequency shows an important
number of frequent sequences that are not terms and, in contrast, does not
suggest the low-frequency terms.
Daille (1994) believes that the best measur e is the likelihood criterion, since it is
a real statistical test, it proposes a cl assification that acc ounts for frequency, it
behaves adequately with large and medium size corpora and it is not defined in
those cases that are not to be considered . In any case, this measure yields some
noise due to several reasons:
a. Errors in the morphological mark-up.
b. Some combinations that are never of a compounding nature: ko bits (kilobits),
à titre d’exemple  (as an example)... ...
c. Combinations of 3 or more elements, related to the problems of composition
and modification: bande latérale  -unique-  (-single- side band), service fixe  -par
satellite-  (-satellite- fixed service) , etc.
2.4. FA S T R7
Reference publication : Jacquemin (1996)
Main goal : Term variation detection
The aim of this tool is to detect terms variants from a set of previously known
terms. These terms may be available from a reference database or a term
acquisition software. What is crucial in this system that it is not needed to start
from scratch every time. Optionally Fastr can also be used for TE.
The first step for applying Fastr is to obtain and analyse a set of existing terms and thus having a set of rules of a given grammar. The FASTR grammatical

6 The formula was experimentally obtained by the autor from the association number described in
Brown et al. (1988) in the aim of fa vouring the most frequent pairs: IM3=log 2 (a3/(a+b)(a-b))

11

formalism is an extension of that of PATR-II (Shieber, 1986). A partial parser
based on the unification mechanism is responsible for the application of these
rules. Term variants are obtained through a metarule mechanism that is
dynamically calculated.
For instance, the term serum albumin  corresponds to the Noun-Noun sequence
and is associated with the following rule:
rule 1: N 1 → N2 N3
&lt;N 1 lexicalization&gt;= ‘N 2’
&lt;N 2 lemma&gt;=serum
&lt;N 3 lemma&gt;=albumin.
The value indicated by the feature “lexicalization” will be use just before partial parsing to selectively activate the target rules. Thus the above rule is linked to the
word serum  and so is activated when this wo rd occurs in the sentence that is
being parsed.
At a different level several metarules generate new rules in order to describe all
possible variations of each term from the re ference list. Each metarule presents a
particular structure and a specific pa ttern type. For instance, the following
metarule can be applied to the previous rule:
Metarule Coor(X 1 Æ X2 X3) = X1 Æ X2 C4 X5 X3
which leads to the new rule: N 1 Æ N2 C4 X5 N3
This latter rule allows new constructions that substitute C 4 for a conjunction and
X5 for an isolated word such as serum  and egg albumin . The candidate term is
not the whole new construction but the coordinated term (i.e., egg albumin ). The
words that have given way to the new rule (egg  and albumin) maintain their
function of constricted equations of the original rule. Further, they are the
anchoring point for the application of the metarule. A metarule can be associated
with specific restricti ons, as for instance: ( &lt;C 4 lemma&gt; ≠but) or ( &lt;X 5 cat&gt; ≠ Dd).
In this way, those sequences with no lexical relationship such as serum and the
albumin are rejected.
The above rule is a coordination rule and it should be noted that there are also
other types of rules that account for different kinds of variations:
1. insertion rules:  medullary carcinoma  Î medullary thyroid carcinoma
2. permutation rules: control center     Î center for disease control
The FASTR metagrammar for English contains 73 metarules altogether: 25
coordination rules, 17 insertion rules and 31 permutation rules. In any case, for
efficiency reasons the new rules are dyna mically generated. Each rule is linked
to a pattern extractor that permits a very quick acquisition of information. As has
been pointed out, the FASTR grammati cal formalism is a PATR-II extension
(Shieber, 1986). This language allows to write grammars using feature structures.
The rules describing terms are composed of a free-context part (N 1 → N2 N3) and 12 Aut omatic Term Detection: a Review of C urrent  Systems
a number of restriction equations (e.g. &lt;N 2 lemma&gt;= serum ). First, the system
filters the rules that are to be applied according to the given text and then an
analysis take place.
When Fastr is applied for term acquisition the process is gradual: from a given
set of terms the system detects new ones, which allows the beginning of a new
cycle and the detection of new candi dates. The loop goes on until new terms
cannot be detected. The author presents an experiment carried out on a medicine
corpus of 1,5 million words and a reference list of 70,000 terms from different
specialised domains. After 15 cycles 17,000 terms were detected of which 5,000
were new. The text was processed at a 2,562 word/minute speed.
However, the number of recognised terms decreases when the reference list has fewer items. For instance, if the reference sublist of medicine drops to 6,000
terms, then only 3,800 new terms are recognised.
The author also postulates the existence of a conceptual relation. between the
new terms and the term that has led to their recognition. This relationship is variable in accordance with th e type of rule that is applied i.e., insertion or
coordination rule. Permutation does not a llow any relationship due to the phrasal
nature of the relationship.
All the language dependent data used by Fa str is stored in separated text files.
This feature facilitates the us e of the system in other languages as showed by the
recent application of Fastr to Japa nese, German and Spanish/Catalan.
Recently Jacquemin has developed the de tection of semantic  variation using
resources like WordNet or the Microsoft Word97 thesaurus (Jacquemin, 1999).
Evaluation
The main characteristic of FASTR is its ability for detecting term variants, an
aspect often not considered by other systems. The fact of using already
recognised and accepted terms is very usef ul, although, as the author admits, it
places restrictions on the ac quisition of new terms that are not related to the
source terms.
TE in Fastr implies that terms that are a dded to the list of valid terms after each
cycle are not validated. Thus, a non-valid term may be added to the list so it is
likely that in forecoming cycles more non-valid terms are added. Jacquemin
(1996) believes that this is not an impor tant error source because the system, in
some way, corrects itself since “normally” non-correct candidates do not give
way to new potential candidate terms.
Actually this technique should not be isolately applied. Rather, it should be
coordinated with other strategies as in (Jacquin &amp; Liscouet 1996) and (Daille
1998).  AUT OMA TIC TERM DETECTION: A REVIEW  OF CURRENT  SYSTEMS

                                                          2.5. HEID
Reference publication:  Heid et al. (1996)
Main goal: Term extraction
Heid et al.  (1996) believe that automatic TE has various applications and
dictionary or glossary construction w ould be the major one. In dictionary
construction from computerized corpora two phases are distinguished: linguistic
pre-analysis and a term identification t ool. Each of these phases requires specific
computer tools.
In the linguistic pre-processing phase the following processes are required8:
a) tokenizing, which identifies word and sentence boundaries.
b) morphosyntactic analysis, which identifies grammatical categories as well as
distributional and morphosyntactic features.
c) POS tagging, which disambiguate morphosyntactic hypotheses.
d) lemmatization, which identifies the lemma candidates.
For term identification the system has a general corpus retrieval interface that
includes a corpus query processor (CQP), a macroprocessor for the CQP query
language and a key word in context (KWIC) program, to extract and sort
concordances and lists of absolute and relative frequency of search items.
TE is linked to a complex query langua ge. The queries will be different
according to the types of candidate term s searched for. Thus, for instance,
queries about single-word terms are made from morphemes or typical
components of compound or derived words (derivatives). In these queries it is
assumed that NP affixed terms from specialised languages use more specific
affixes and/or prefixes than others. A ll the word sequence ex tracted (N-A, N-N,
N-V), are based on POS patterns.
Heid et al.  (1996) have applied these tools to technical texts on automobile
engineering in German, which amounts to 35,000 words. The sample has been
manually analysed before the application of the above procedures. The results
are as follows:
• With regard to single-word terms, there has been found a 90% of candidate
terms and a 10% of silence. This rate  varies from one scheme to another.
• With regard to multiword terms, there are no concluding results. The results are less satisfactory and that the same problems as linguistic based are
found: POS patterns do not constrain enough the context and produce too
much noise. Heid et al.  (1996) believe that by using a syntactic parser, as it
is the case in English, noise would diminish.

8 Heid et al.  (1996) note that a broad coverage morphosynt actic parser for German is not attained.
Thus parser results are simulated using POS patterns.   14 Aut omatic Term Detection: a Review of C urrent  Systems
• Finally, collocation extraction is shown to produce noise but not silence,
since Heid et al.  (1996) consider the frequency criterion.
The Ahmad’s statistical measure (Ahmad et al , 1992) of relative frequency in
corpora of specialised and general language  is applied to this corpus of 35,000
words. They show that the results produced by linguistic corpus query are
included in the output of statistical methods. However noise in statistical
methods is higher than in linguistic methods.
Evaluation
To tackle this system it should be taken into account the morphosyntactic
features of the German language. Unlike Romance languages, German prefers to form compounds in a synthesising manner. It means that what other languages
express via terminological phrases in German is expressed with a single-word
term (by word is meant any segment found between two gaps). Thus it can be
seen that in German automatic term detection does not depend much on term
delimitation but on the terminological nature of a word. This is the reason why
we need parameters to distinguish a te rm from a word of the general language,
both having the same morphosyntactic structure.
Like most of the reviewed programs, Heid focuses on NP terms although it can also extract collocations combining nouns and verbs. In this case Heid et al.
(1996) note that the results are much worse. We do not have specific data about
the performance and the results of this system.
2.6. LEXTER
Reference publication:  Bourigault (1994)
Main goal: Term extraction
This system has been developed in the need of the EDF ( Electricité de France )
society for improving their indexation system. LEXTER aims at locating boundaries among which potentially terminological NPs could be isolated.
LEXTER carries a superficial analysis a nd makes use of the text heuristics in
order to obtain those NPs of maximum length that it regards as candidate terms.
The program is composed of several modules and works as follows:
1. Morphological analysis and disambiguation module . Texts receive information
about the POS and the lemma assigned to every word.
2. Delimitation module . At this stage a local syntactic analysis is carried so as to
split the text into maximal-length NPs. For example: alimentation en eau (water
supply),  pompe d’extraction  (extraction pump),  alimentation electrique de la
pompe de refoulement  (electric supply of the forcing back supply). Here the
system takes advantage of the negative knowledge about the parts of complex
terms. Thus those patterns of a potential term − finite verbs, pronouns and
conjunctions − that will never become part of a term are identified and considered AUT OMA TIC TERM DETECTION: A REVIEW  OF CURRENT  SYSTEMS
15

as boundaries. Some of these patterns are simple whereas others are complex
(sequences of preposition + determiner).
A French example of the latter would be SUR (prep) + LE (definite article): the
most common analysis is to propose that this sequence establishes a boundary
between NPs as in: on raccorde le câble d’alimentation du banc sur le  coffret de
décharge batterie. However there is a rate (10%) in which this sequence is part
of the term: action sur le  bouton poussoir de réarmement or action sur le
systeme d’alimentation de secours
To solve this and other similar situations, the system uses an endogenous
learning strategy of the patterns sub-categorisation. This strategy consists in
looking at the corpus to find those sequences of (noun) + sur + le  having
different contexts on the right hand side. Then non-productive nouns are weeded
out. Then sequences such as s ur + le  are considered sentence boundaries, except
for those cases wherein sequences are preceded by the productive noun located
in the learning phase. To see how this system works let us suppose that at a first
analysis the sequences below are found.
Le protection contre
Protection contre
il s’agit de maintenir la teneur en oxygène de cette eau dans

on procède à l’injection d’eau dans
le système permet l’aiguillage des automates sur le gel est assurée par
les grands froids
les limites fixées
les limites fixées
les générateurs de vapeur
le prélèvement effectué
Then productive sequences are not regarded as term boundaries whereas non-productive sequences are viewed as extern al boundaries of the candidate term. In
the example above protection contre  and eau dans  do not become boundaries
whereas automates sur  does.
This strategy permits to detect a considerable amount of complex nouns which otherwise would have been lost. Unfortunately it also allows a great deal of
undesirable material (between 10% and 50%).
3. Splitting module . NPs are analysed and their constituents are divided into head
and expansion. For example the term candidate pompe d’extraction (extraction
pump)  is splitted into : pompe –head– (pump) + extraction – expansion–
(extraction).
At this point the system may find ambiguous situations such as “Noun Adj 1
Adj 2” and “Noun 1 Prep Noun 2 Adj” whose analysis is uncertain. To solve these
cases an endogenous learning process is followed which is similar to that
presented in the delimitation module.
4. Structuring module . The list of term candidates is organised in a
terminological network. This network can be produced only by looking at a list
of candidate terms and recognising the di fferent parts of each candidate term,
like in the following example: 16 Aut omatic Term Detection: a Review of C urrent  Systems

terminologist as a piece of data so as to facilitate the evaluation of candidate
terms.

2.7. NAULLEAU
Reference publication:  Naulleau (1998)
Main goal: Noun phrase filtering system
The model designed by Naulleau is a NP extraction system that proposes as term
candidates those sequences that comply with certain user tailored profile. The
whole process can be divided in two main stages: profile acquisition and profile
application.
To define its own profile the user chooses the set of phrases that s/he considers
relevant for his task and discards the ones that s/he does not consider useful at
that time. The data collect ed in such way is gene ralised according to their
morphological, syntactical and semantic characteristics dynamically creating a
set of positive and negative filters. A simple example of positive and negative
filters is the following:
(1) positive filter: metallic/automatic/nuclear/industrial taps
(2) negative filter: important/recent/necessary/unreliable taps
Then, those filters produced in the lear ning stage are applied to new sequences
analysed. As a result, some noun arguments and/or PPs can be eliminated. Thus a
NP can be divided or reduced and the resulting sequences are passed on to an
expert to be evaluated.
In doing so the author acknowledges the sociolinguistic nature of the term. It
implies that there is no linguistic model that can tell whether a NP is a term or
not beyond the scope of a field or even the application. Also, this procedure
introduces the idea of how relevant a phrase is in relation to the interest profile of
the user and assumes that such relevance may be evaluated on linguistic grounds.
This is a fully symbolic approach that uses the AlethIP engine that produces
sentences fully lemmatised, tagged and syntactically parsed. Then nouns and
adjectives are semantically tagged acco rding to both suffix information and
semantic data from AlethIP and using a set of contextual rules for the more
frequent and ambiguous words. The whole strategy is based on the evaluation of
the relevance of simple syntactic depende ncies. Such relevance is only based on
the data provided by the user.
According to the author, the results are encouraging. However it is difficult to
evaluate due to the practical problem posed by such a detailed evaluation. Some
additional experiments are described in (Nalleau, 1999).
Evaluation
This system may be considered the first one to use semantic data as a specific
resource for proposing term candidates. Also, as far as we know, is the first time
since the very beginning in the design of a TE systems that the user and the idea
of relevance to an application are taken into account. 18 Aut omatic Term Detection: a Review of C urrent  Systems
In this way the user may adapt the syst em to its specific needs but also its
intervention may crucially affect the performance of the system. The loss of
specific data makes difficult to evaluate the tool behaviour in an actual context.
2.8. NEURAL
Reference publication:  Frantzi and Ananiadou (1995)
Main goal: Term extraction
Neural is a system for TE of a hybrid nature, that is it uses both linguistic
(morphosyntactic patterns and a list of suffixes specific to the domain) and
statistically knowledge (frequency and mutual information). Frantzi &amp;
Ananiadou (1995) pays special attention to two different problems: detection of
nested terms and detection of low frequency terms using statistical methods.
The test bench is a corpus of 55,000 words in the domain of medicine
(ophthalmology). The structures analysed are Noun-Noun and Adjective-Noun
that are identified using a standard tagger. The list of suffixes includes those
frequently found in terminological units in the field of ophthalmology like -oid, -
oma, - ium. The system is implemented using a Back-Propagation (BP) two
layers neural network. The threshold has b een set to .5 but this may vary. The BP
neural network has been trained with a set of 300 compounds and the tests were
made with another set of 300 words. It obtained a success rate of 70 %.
The author and other scholars from the Manchester Metropolitan University have
been active since 1995 developing specific statistical figures for TE. In this way
it is necessary to mention those tasks related to the adding of context information
(Frantzi, 1997, Maynard &amp; Ananiadou, 1999). Usually the context is discarded
or, alternatively, considered as a bag of words although its relevance is signalled
by many scholars. Here the basic assumption is that terms tend to appear
grouped in real text, so the termhood figure of a candidate would increase if there are other terms (or candidates highly ranked) in the context.
Both Frantzi, 1997 and Maynard &amp; Ananiadou, 1999 propose a similarity figure based on the distance between the candidate and the context words (nouns,
adjectives and verbs). This figure is calculated by Frantzi (1997) using statistical
and syntactic information while Maynard &amp; Ananiadou (1999) include also
semantic information from a specialised thesaurus (UMLS semantic Network).
In Maynard &amp; Ananiadou (1999) this similarity figure may also be used to take
into account some kind of semantic disambiguation for the sense that gets a
better value. A context factor (CF) is added to the figure already used to rank the
candidates (Cvalue) and thus reorderi ng the set of candidates as follows:
SNCvalue(a) = 0.8*Cvalue(a) + 0.2*CF(a). The authors report improvements in
the ranking of term candidates from his eye pathology corpus.
Evaluation AUT OMA TIC TERM DETECTION: A REVIEW  OF CURRENT  SYSTEMS
19

The original system can be seen as a standard hybrid system. The linguistic
knowledge includes Greek and Latin affixes and morphosyntactic patterns. The
incorporation of this kind of suffixes should be highly productive. However the
chosen patterns may well apply to English but not to Romance Languages.
The incorporation of the context as part of the data available for evaluating the
termhood of a candidate is a very interesting contribution to the behaviour of
terms in real texts. It should also serve to increase the relevance of low frequency
candidates but no specific figure is given.
It is necessary to mention the use of semantic information as a kind of resource that is increasingly used in the TE field.
2.9. NODALIDA-95
Reference publication : Arppe (1995)
Main goal : Term extraction
NODALIDA, a product designed by the Lingsoft firm, is based on an enhanced
version of NPtool that is a program de veloped at the Department of General
Linguistics at the Helsinki Univers ity (Finland). NPtool (V outilanen 1993)
generates lists of NPs occurring in the sentences of a text and provides an
assessment about whether these phrases are candidates terms or not (ok/?). From
these lists all the acceptable sub-chains ar e obtained. Besides, the source list is
multiplied. Let us see an actual example, for the sentence: “ exact form of the
correct theory of quantum gravity “ NPtool proposes the following additional
NPs:
form of the correct theory of quantum  gravity  form   correct theory
exact form of the correct theory    exact form   gravity
form of the correct theory     theory  quantum gravity
Simultaneously there are a number of premises that become the first filter like in
the following: “Those NPs preceded by a determiner, adjective or prefixed
sentence ( kind of, some, one, ... ) are weeded out.”
As for the remaining NPs, their occurren ce frequency is calculated. Further, they
are ordered and grouped according to thei r grammatical head and are presented
to the terminologist together with thei r context. The NPtool module (V outilanen,
1993) is at the heart of the system. It is a NP detector largely based on the
constraint grammar formalism (Karlsson, 1990). Its main features are: (1)
Morphological/syntactical descriptions are based on a large set of hand-coded
linguistic rules, (2) both the grammar and the lexicon allow a corpus analysis
with non-controlled text and (3) disa mbiguation is made according to only
linguistic criteria. As a result, between 3% and 6% of the words remain
ambiguous. 20 Aut omatic Term Detection: a Review of C urrent  Systems
The text goes through a previous process so as to determine sentence boundaries,
idiomatic expressions, compound forms, typographical signs, etc. Then it is
morphologically analysed and a result like this is obtained9:
(“&lt;*the&gt;”  (“the” DET CE NTRAL ART SG/PL (@&gt;N)))
(“&lt;inlet&gt;”  (“inlet” N NOM SG))
(“&lt;and&gt;”  (“and” CC (@CC)))
(“&lt;exhaust&gt;” (“exhaust” &lt;SVO&gt;  V SUBJUNCTIVE VFIN (@V))
   (“exhaust” &lt;SVO&gt; V IMP VFIN (@V))
   (“exhaust” &lt;SVO&gt; V INF)
   (“exhaust” &lt;SVO&gt; V PRES -SG3 VFIN (@V))
   (“exhaust” N NOM SG))
(“&lt;manifold&gt;” (“manifold” N NOM PL))
At this moment disambiguation takes place. For example in the sentence: ” The
inlet and exhaust manifolds are mounted on opposite sides of the cylinder head “
two analyses are obtained:
(1) on/@AH opposite/@N side s/@NH of/@N&lt; the/@&gt;N cylinder/@NH  head/@V
(2) on/@AH opposite/@N side s/@NH of/@N&lt; the/@&gt;N cylinder/@&gt;N  head/@NH
What distinguishes these two analyses is the consideration of whether the final sequence ( cylinder head) is a NP or not. The ongoing process gives only two
possible analyses for each sentence. First, those NPs of a maximal length are
preferred ( NP-friendly ) and, second, those NPs of a minimal length are preferred
(NP-hostile ). Then the system compares both strategies and labels each NP as
ok/? by considering whether the analysis is shared or not by both strategies
Thus the last sentence gets this analysis below:
(3) ok : inlet and exhaust manifolds   ?: opposite sides of the cylinder
ok: exhaust manifolds     ? :  opposite sides of the cylinder head
In order to validate this additional information the terminologist is provided with
a list of candidate terms. The results reported by the NPtool module are pretty
good (precision=95-98% and r ecall=98.5-100%) with a text of about 20 Kwords.
Evaluation
NODALIDA is based on the use of linguistic knowledge through a structural
approach (i.e., detection of phrasal structures and structural disambiguation).
Arppe (1995) presents high-quality results. However, the corpus should be
enlarged, since so far tests have been made  on quite small corpora. It is not clear
how precision and recall figures are calculated, particularly how to determine
which terms are deemed to be correct (i.e., those which have the ok signal or all
of them). Also it should be stressed that NODALIDA has not been tested using the NPtool enhanced version in an actual situation of terminology problems.

9 The meaning of the syntactic function tags are: @&gt;N = pre-modifier; @&lt;N = post-modifier; @CC
and @CS= coordination and subor dination conjunction; @V = Verb; @NH = nominal head. Finally,
“&gt;” and “&lt;” indicate the direction of the phrasal head. AUT OMA TIC TERM DETECTION: A REVIEW  OF CURRENT  SYSTEMS
21

Taking into account that the disambiguator is one of the main error sources in
this kind of systems, Arppe (1995) belie ves that a high-degree quality is achieved
despite the fact that there are no data about terminology extraction in real
situations. Besides, to achieve this quality NODALIDA proposes a great deal of
rules, which yields management and control overhead.
The list that is passed on to the terminologist to be validated comprises those
candidates signalled with ok and ?. The way in which potential NPs are obtained
by the system leads us to suspect that  there are many candidate terms in the
validation list that the terminologist has to analyse.
2.10. TERMIGHT
Reference publication:  Dagan and Church (1994)
Main goal: Translation aid
Termight is currently used by A&amp;T Business Translation Systems. It was created
to be a tool for automating some stages of the professional translator
terminological research.
To do so it starts with a tagged and disambiguated text as well as a list of
predetermined syntactic patterns that could be adjusted to every document. Thus,
a list of candidate terms is obtained comprising one or more words. Single-word
candidates are defined as all those words that are not included in a previously
determined list of empty words (i.e. stop list). Multiword terms are referred to
one of the predetermined syntactic patte rns via regular expressions. Dagan and
Church (1994) considered only noun sequences patterns.
Candidate terms are grouped and classifi ed according to their lemma (i.e. the
right hand side noun) and frequency. Thos e candidates sharing the same lemma
are classified alphabetically in accord ance with the inverse order of their
compounding words. Thus it is showed the order of changes of the English
simple NPs.
For each candidate term the corresponding concordances are obtained, which are
alphabetically classified acco rding to their context. Th is information enables the
terminologist to evaluate  whether each candidate is appropriate or not.
Dagan and Church (1994) note that the rate of term list construction is of 150 and 200 terms per hour, which is twice faster than the average. As for the
extraction quality, they state that, un like exclusively statistical methods,
Termight permits to extract low-frequency terms.
Moreover this system has a bilingual module which, via statistical methods,
obtains a word-level alignment from texts. Thus terms found in language A are
referred to their counterparts in language B. This well-ordered list of candidate
terms is again passed on to the terminologist to be evaluated. 22 Aut omatic Term Detection: a Review of C urrent  Systems
The Termight bilingual module does not seem to be developed and tested as the
basic one. Tests have been made on 192 terms from a technical manual in
English and German. The correct translation is found in the first suggested
solution in 40% of the cases, whereas only 7% corresponds to the correct
translation suggested in the second place.  As for the remaining, the correct
translation was in other places of the proposal list.
Evaluation
Termight is a remarkable system in that  there is an accurate classification and
presentation of candidate terms and it does not attempt to become an automatic
system. Rather, it helps the translator.
However, it presents a number of shortcomings: (1) The only syntactic pattern
considered is very simple: noun sequences . This pattern may well be valid for
English but not for Romance languages and (2) no numerical information about the recognition quality is given. The ty pe of pattern considered may suppose
high precision but low recall

2.11. TERMINO
Reference publication:  Plante and Dumas (1989)
Main goal: Facilitation of the term extraction terminographer’s task.
The TERMINO program is composed of several tools to facilitate TE in French.
It is a help for the terminologist insofar as the identification of those discourse
units that denominate notions or objects. Besides it provides every unit with the
immediate context from which data relevant to the notions denominated by
theses units can be obtained. There are a number of TERMINO versions which improve in some ways previous ones.
This tool is based mainly on linguistic knowledge and it comprises 3 sub-systems: a pre-editor, which separate s texts into words and sentences and
identifies proper nouns, a morphosyntactic parser and a record-drafting facility.
The text does not get any special treatment: it is only required to be codified in ASCII form.
With regard to term delimitation and extraction the more interesting sub-system
is the morphosyntactic parser. It consists of 3 modules: a morphological parser; a
syntactic parser and a synapsy detector.
The morphological parser has two functions: a) automatic categorisation; b)
lemma and tag identification. According to Plante and Dumas, 30% of words in French can be attributed to more than one category. This has led to the tagging of
all the possible categories for each word. As a result, there is an overproduction
of words with different tags. Categorisation and lemmatisation are obtained from
the application of the LCML program, it is not a dictionary but a morphological
parser of lexical forms so it can correc tly lemmatise and tag new lexical forms. AUT OMA TIC TERM DETECTION: A REVIEW  OF CURRENT  SYSTEMS
23

The syntactic parser is responsible for weeding out the vast majority of
ambiguities generated in previous stages . It is managed through the construction
of a syntactic structure for each sentence.
Finally, the synapsy detector (MRSF) selects, among the syntactic units from the parser, those lexical noun units that are likely to be terms. S. David (David and
Plante, 1991) created MRSF especially for TERMINO. MRSF is based on
principles of noun group construction. Da vid’s understanding of synapsy is that
of a polylexical unit of a syntactic nature that is the head of the NP. Thus,
synapsies are only NPs groups: some of them will become terms and some of
them will not. Further, some of them will only be “topics” that will enable the
terminologist to know different concepts or grasp an overview of the text topics.
The MRSF module comprises 5 sub-modules: (1) head hunter module; (2)
expansion recogniser module; (3) categor isation module; (4) synapsy generator
module and (5) representation and evaluation module.
TERMINO has a set of software tools, which is much larger and comprises different modules that allow to manipulate terminological data. These tools help
the terminologist decide whether a synapsy is a term or not, elaborate
terminological filing forms and create terminological databases.
TERMINO recognises between 70% and 74% of the complex terms. The fact that 30% of terms are not recognised by TERMINO can be explained by
coordination (it is a signal of segment breaking), acronyms and common nouns
in capital letters. Moreover, there is 28% of noise, of which 47% is due to a
wrong mark-up and a 53% is due to sy napsies belonging to general language.
Evaluation
TERMINO is one of the first candidate term extractors that worked and it is a
linguistically-based extractor, composed of different independent modules. This
system is based on the concept of synapsy . The synapsy detector is based on the
establishment of a number of heuristic rules that may well be increased provided
the corpus is delimited.
There is a need to improve this system taking into account that it is still too noisy
(28%), which could be improved, for example, with a different treatment of
capital letters and acronyms.
2.12. TERMS
Reference publication:  Justeson and Katz (1995)
Main goal: Term extraction
Justeson and Katz (1995) hold the following views about terms:
a) Terminological noun phrases (TNP) are different from non-terminological noun phrases (nTNP) in that the modifiers of the first ones are much shorter than
those of the second ones. 24 Aut omatic Term Detection: a Review of C urrent  Systems
b) An entity introduced by a nTNP can be later referred to only by the head of the
NP and often by other NP (synonyms, hyponyms, hyperonyms). By contrast, an
entity introduced by a TNP is normally rep eated identically in a given document,
as a single omission of a modifier could yield a change of the referred entity.
c) In technical texts lexical NPs ar e almost exclusively terminological.
d) Multiword technical terms are near ly always composed of nouns and
adjectives (97%) and some prepositions (3%) between two NPs.
e) The average length of a TNP is of 1.91 words.
The proposed filter finds strings with a frequency equal or higher than two. These strings follow with this regul ar expression: ((A|N)+ | ((A|N)*(N
P)?)(A|N)*N. Those candidate terms of a length of 2 (2 patterns: AN and NA)
and 3 (5 patterns: AAN, ANN, NAN, NNN and NPN) are by far the most
commonly encountered.
The purpose of this algorithm is to combine good coverage of the usual
terminology from technical texts with high quality in the extraction phase. The
algorithm prefers quality to coverage, since if it only made use of the
grammatical constraints then the system would propose many irrelevant NPs.
The vast majority of relevant NPs overcome the frequency constraint.
Selection of grammatical patterns also affects quality. If prepositions are admitted within the pattern many candi dates are introduced, although few will be
valid. As a result, quality decreases whereas quantity increases and, accordingly,
Justeson and Katz (1995) prefer not to take prepositions into consideration.
The implementation of grammatical patterns also affects the quality/coverage
trade-off. There are two ways in which a given linguistic unit is attributed to a
grammatical category: disambiguation and filtering. The first one is rejected
because disambiguators are not totally reliable yet.
Filtering consist in parsing and lemmatisi ng each word of the text. Then those
sequences following the pattern are consid ered. If a word is not identified as a
noun, adjective or preposition, it is dis carded. Thus each word maintains its
nominal, adjectival and prepositional values and in this order. The chain is
weeded out if more than one word can be identified as a preposition or if it does
not follow the pattern (e.g. if the pattern ends with a noun and there is more than
one preposition then the word following the preposition is not a noun).
Filtering has a coverage at least as good as what can be attained by a standard
tagger. However, quality is not that good (e.g. fixed  is only identified as an
adjective – bug fixed –, but it can also become a verb: fixed disk drive ). In
contrast, filtering is much faster than parsing.
In any case, Justeson and Katz (1995) suggest to control the patterns, the list of
grammatical words and the frequency to ad just the performance of the system to
each type of text. AUT OMA TIC TERM DETECTION: A REVIEW  OF CURRENT  SYSTEMS
25

This system has been applied to different domains (metallurgy, spatial
engineering and nuclear energy) and it is used at IBM Translation Center. The
TERMS results are presented on the basis of 3 technical texts (statistical
classification of patterns, lexical semantics and chromatography). Coverage has
only been estimated for one of the text and it is of 71%. Quality has been
estimated between 77% and 96% of the instances.
Evaluation
Although Justeson and Katz (1995) present a detailed study on the performance of terminological units (wherein there are some overstatements), the proposed
filter does not seem to take advantage of these previous analyses of terms.
Further, it should be noted that this type of filtering based on quite simple
patterns would not be so efficient if they were applied to languages other than
English such as Romance languages. Also, this kind of patterns produces a lot of
noise.
3. Contrastive Analysis
Here we will contrast the systems’ ma in features, according to six relevant
aspects when designing a new detection system of terminological units:
linguistic resources, strategies of term de limitation, strategies of term filtering,
classification of recognised terms and obtained results. For some of these criteria
we have created a table containing the mo st significant data so as to make the
system comparison easier.
3.1. Linguistic resources
It has been observed that the vast majority of the reviewed systems make use of
some sort of linguistic information, at least a list of empty words taken as
boundaries. The standard process includes a morphological analysis followed by
some kind of disambiguation system. The systems altering this procedure are the
following:
a. ANA: does not use any linguistic resource, just a list of auxiliary words
b. TERMS: use its own disambiguation system: POS filtering
c. Naulleau: introduces semantic information
Additionally, for the systems that use an incremental strategy, like ANA and
Fastr, it is necessary a set of in itial terms to bootstrap the process.
3.2. Strategies of term delimitation
All systems of terminology extraction have to determine at some point the beginning and the end of the candidate term, that is, delimit the potential
terminological unit. The reviewed programs have different strategies to delimit 26 Aut omatic Term Detection: a Review of C urrent  Systems
terms: word-boundary elements, structural patterns, syntactic parser, text
distribution, typographical elements, term lists, structure disambiguation. Below
we show a summary of the differen t options adopted by each system:

3.3. Strategies of term filtering
Term filtering is a key stage of any term detection system. This means that the
list of candidates is reduced as much as possible. The following table shows the
strategies found in all the reviewed systems:

3.4. Classification of recognised terms
Some of the analysed systems classify recognised terms by grouping them
according to some criteria. Thus, the related terms stay close to each other. Even
FASTR attempts to infer an ontology from the recognised terms. Those systems
which show some classification of recognised terms are the following:
a. ANA: it builds a semantic netw ork from the detected terms.
b. FASTR: it builds a graph to relate recognised terms. Also it proposes the
construction of partial ontologies for some terms.
c. LEXTER: it builds a terminological network splitting terms into head and
expansion.

  <conclusion>We can reach some conclusions after havi ng analysed and evaluated some of the
main systems of TE designed in the last decade:

11 The system has been intensively te sted with regard to the indexing frequency, but not in relation to
the quality of the extracted terms. 28 Aut omatic Term Detection: a Review of C urrent  Systems
a) The efficiency of the extraction presen ts a high degree of variation from one
to another. Broadly speaking, there is neither clear nor measurable explanation of
the final results. Besides, we have to b ear in mind that these systems are tested
with small and highly specialised corpora. This lack of data makes it difficult to
evaluate and compare them. However, it does not prevent pinpointing those
solutions, which are considered va lid to solve specific problems.
b) None of the systems is entirely satisfactory due to two main reasons. First, all
systems produce too much silence, especially statistically-based systems.
Second, all of them generate a great deal of noise, especially linguistically-based
systems.
c) Taking into account the noise generated, all systems propose large lists of
candidate terms, which at the end of the process have to be manually accepted or
rejected.
d) Most of the TE systems are related to only one language: French or English.
Usually the language specific data is embedded in the tool. This makes difficult to use the system in a language other than the original.
e) As has been already pointed out, traini ng corpora tend to be small (from 2.3 to
12 Kwords) and highly specialised with regard to the topic as well as the
specialisation degree. This allows for a quite precise patterns and lexicosemantic,
formal and morphosyntactic heuristics albeit this only applies to highly
specialised corpora.
f) All systems focus entirely on NPs and none of them deals with verbal phrases.
This is because there is a high rate of terminological NPs in specialised texts.
This rate can vary according to the topi c and the specialisation degree. Despite
what has just been noted, it is noteworthy that all specialised languages have their own verbs (or specific combinations of a verbal nature), no matter how low the ratio is in comparison with nouns.
g) As a result, none of the systems refers to the distinction between nominal
collocations and nominal terminological units of a syntactic nature. Nor do they
refer to phraseology.
h) Many of the systems make use of a number of morphosyntactic patterns to
identify complex terms. However they account for most of the terminological
units they are still too few and also not very constraining. Thus, for English are
AN and NN, for French NA and N prep N.  Some terms present structures other
than these ones and they are never det ected. Those systems based only on these
types of linguistic techniques generate too much noise.
i) It is generally agreed that frequency is a good criterion to indicate that a
candidate term is actually a terminological unit. However, frequency is not on its
own a sufficient criterion, as it yields a great deal of noise.
j) Only a few recent systems use semantic  information to recognise and delimit
terminological units although its use takes place at different levels. AUT OMA TIC TERM DETECTION: A REVIEW  OF CURRENT  SYSTEMS
29

k) None of the systems uses extensively the combinatory features of terms from
specialised languages in relation to a given domain. It is needed more studies
about the type of constraints that terminological units present with regard to
conceptual field and text type.
l) Only one of the analysed systems take profit of the possibilities given by the
alignment of specialised text.
i) Most of the authors consider the POS disambiguation as one of the most
important error sources. However, they do not provide exact figures about its
incidence degree.
To improve these systems of terminology extraction and lessen the noise and
silence that are generated, two type of studies should be encouraged. First, it is
required more linguistic oriented studies on the semantic relationships among
terms, the semantic relationships among constituents of a terminological unit,
semantico-lexical representation, constraints of terminological units within a
given specialised domain and in a given text type, all the grammatical categories
that are likely to become terms in specialised domai ns, the influence of the
syntactic function of terminological phrases on texts, the relationships between
terms and their arrangement in texts.
Second, we should focus on software systems that: combine in a more active manner statistical and linguistic methods; improve statistical measures; combine
more than one strategy; are easily applicable to more than one language; improve
interfaces to facilitate the m achine-user interaction. Also it should be very useful,
as suggested in Kageura et al.  (1998), the development of a common test bench
for aiding the evaluation/comparison of extracting methods.
In sum, should we progress in the field of automatic terminology extraction,
statistical and linguistic methods have to actively be combined. It means that
they are not either-or approaches but co mplementary ones. The final goal is to
reduce the amount of silence and noise so that the process of terminological
extraction becomes as automatic and preci se as possible. In the future, we
believe that any current terminology extractor, apart from accounting for the
morphological, syntactic and structural aspects of terminological units, has to
necessarily include semantic aspects if th e efficiency of the system is to be
improved with regard to the existing ones.</conclusion>
